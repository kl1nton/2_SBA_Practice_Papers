	A. L3
	B. L4
	C. L5
	D. S1
	E. S2

#### Answer: C. L5 - *FALSE* = B. L4 - TRUE
- L4 dermatome supplies the sensation of the medial leg from the knee down to the medial aspect of the big toe
- L3 primarily supplies the superior knee and medial thigh region
- L5 supplies the lateral leg
- S1 the lateral foot and heel
 
### Q5	
All of the following are complications of _transurethral resection of prostate_ (TURP), EXCEPT:

	A. Urethral stricture - T
	B. Retrograde ejaculation - T
	C. HyPERnatraemia - F
	D. Incontinence - T
	E. Increased risk of myocardial infarction

#### Answer: E. Increased risk of myocardial infarction - *FALSE* = C. HyPERnatraemia - TRUE
- TURP is performed by passing a resectoscope through the urethra into the bladder and using a wire loop to pass electrical current to resect the prostate gland. It is a relatively safe procedure (mortality <0.25%) but is associated with certain complications. These include urinary incontinence (2–4%), erectile dysfunction (5%), urethral stricture (5%), retrograde ejaculation (65%) and increase risk of MI. In addition there is the risk of developing TUR syndrome, which is due to the absorption of irrigation fluid into the body. This presents with hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting and collapse. Blood tests show hyponatraemia.
 
### Q6	
Which of the following _muscles of mastication_ inserts into the _neck of the mandible_ and _anterior surface of the disc_ of the temporomandibular joint?

	A. Lateral pterygoid
	B. Medial pterygoid
	C. Masseter - F
	D. Buccinator - F
	E. Temporalis - F

#### Answer: A. Lateral pterygoid - TRUE
- Muscles of mastication include the lateral and medial pterygoids, the masseter muscle and the temporalis muscle. The buccinator muscle is a muscle of facial expression and not a mastication muscle. All of the muscles of mastication are supplied by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Buccinator is supplied by the facial nerve.
 
- The lateral pterygoid arises as two heads from the lateral aspect of the lateral pterygoid plate and inserts into the neck of the mandible and the anterior surface of the disc of the temporomandibular joint. The medial pterygoid arises from the medial aspect of the lateral pterygoid plate and a small tubercle of the maxilla and its fibres insert inferolaterally into the roughened medial surface of the mandible near the angle.

- The temporalis muscle arises from the temporal fossa and inserts into the coronoid process of the mandible. The masseter arises from the anterior two-thirds of the lower border of the zygomatic arch as well as the posterior third of the lower border and the whole of the deep surface of the arch. It then inserts into the outer surface of the ramus of the mandible from the mandibular notch above, down to the angle of the mandible. Both temporalis and masseter are palpable on the facial examination as superficial muscles.
 
### Q7 - LEARN
Which one of these _muscle and nerve pairings_ is correct?

	A. Stylopharyngeus – glossopharyngeal nerve
	B. Tensor veli palatini – pharyngeal plexus - F
	C. Buccinator – cranial nerve Vc - F
	D. Palatoglossus – hypoglossal nerve - F
	E. Cricothyroid – recurrent laryngeal nerve - F

#### Answer: C. Buccinator – cranial nerve Vc - *FALSE* = A. Stylopharyngeus – glossopharyngeal nerve - TRUE
- There are a few simple rules for muscle innervation. All pharyngeal and palatal muscles are supplied by the pharyngeal plexus (IX, X and sympathetics), except stylopharyngeus, which is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) and tensor veli palatini, which is supplied by the nerve to the medial pterygoid (Vc). All tongue muscles are supplied by the hypoglossal nerve (XII), except palatoglossus, which is supplied by the pharyngeal plexus. Muscles of facial expression are supplied by the facial nerve (VII), except levator palpabrae superioris, which is supplied by the oculomotor nerve (III). Muscles of mastication are supplied by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (Vc), except buccinator, which is supplied by the facial nerve. Laryngeal muscles are supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (X), except cricothyroid, which is supplied by the superior laryngeal nerve (X).
 
### Q8	
Concerning _parasympathetic nerve supply_, which one of the following pairings is correct?

	A. Otic ganglion – submandibular gland
	B. Pterygopalatine ganglion – lacrimal gland
	C. Pterygopalatine ganglion – parotid gland - F
	D. Auriculotemporal nerve – submandibular gland - F
	E. Facial nerve – otic ganglion - F

#### Answer: B. Pterygopalatine ganglion – lacrimal gland - TRUE
- Parasympathetic supply arises from cranial nerves III, VII, IX and X. Oculomotor fibres (CN III, Edinger–Westphal nucleus) pass to the ciliary ganglion before supplying pupillary constriction and accommodation. Facial fibres (CN VII, superior salivary nucleus), via the nervus intermedius and greater petrosal nerve, pass to the pterygopalatine and submandibular ganglion, supplying the lacrimal, submandibular, sublingual and palatine glands. Glossopharyngeal fibres (CN IX, inferior salivary nucleus) run via the lesser petrosal to the otic ganglion and then in the auriculotemporal nerve to the parotid gland. Vagus fibres (CN X, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus) pass to the thorax and abdomen.
 
### Q9
A patient arrives in the Emergency Department with the following arterial blood gas results: PaO2 8.0 kPa; PaCO2 2.0 kPa; pH 7.54; bicarbonate 18 mmol/l. The most likely cause is:

	A. Excessive vomiting
	B. Pulmonary embolus (PE) - F
	C. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - F
	D. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) - ?
	E. Chest wall trauma - F

#### Answer: A. Excessive vomiting - *FALSE* = B. Pulmonary embolus (PE)
- The example shows a patient with low PaO2, low PaCO2, high pH and low bicarbonate. When PaCO2 is low, it shifts the following equilibrium to the left
	- CO2 + H2O <> H2CO3 < > H+ + HCO3–
therefore reducing the concentration of H+ and causing a respiratory alkalosis
- From the given examples, PE is the most likely cause
	- this results in hyperventilation, which ‘blows off’ and therefore reduces blood levels of CO2 
	- but at the same time **fails to achieve satisfactory oxygenation**
 
### Q10 - LEARN	
The operation of choice for treatment of a _strangulated femoral hernia_, which is likely to contain _infarcted small bowel_ is:

	A. McEvedy’s abdominal approach
	B. Lothiessen’s high approach
	C. Lockwood’s crural or low approach
	D. Bassini’s low repair
	E. Lower midline laparotomy

#### Answer: A. McEvedy’s abdominal approach - TRUE
- The abdominal approach is best reserved where bowel resection is contemplated
- An inguinal or high approach is used to repair co-existing inguinal hernias or where the diagnosis is in doubt
- For small uncomplicated femoral hernias in the elective setting, the low or crural approach is preferable


Questions 11-20

??% = F: 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20

### Q11 - LEARN
A 21-year-old medical student presents to the Emergency Department with conjunctivitis. You prescribe him eye drops, but he mentions that he dislikes taking them as he gets a bitter taste at the back of his throat. You explain that the lacrimal drainage is connected to the nasopharynx, hence the bitter taste. He wishes to know exactly where the drainage occurs. 

Within the lateral wall of the nasal cavity the _nasolacrimal duct_ opens at the:

	A. Superior meatus - F
	B. Middle meatus - F
	C. Inferior meatus
	D. Spheno-ethmoidal recess 
	E. Nasopharynx - F

#### Answer: D. Spheno-ethmoidal recess - *FALSE* = C. Inferior meatus - TRUE
- The nasolacrimal duct enters the nasal cavity under the anterior lip of the inferior concha in the inferior meatus and connects the conjunctival sac to the nasal cavity for drainage of tears. The frontal sinus, anterior and middle ethmoidal sinuses and the maxillary sinus open into the middle meatus under the middle concha at the hiatus semilunaris. The posterior ethmoidal sinus opens into the superior meatus and the sphenoidal sinus onto the sphenoethmoidal recess. The opening of the pharyngotympanic tube, which is bounded by salpingopharyngeus, opens into the nasopharynx posterior to all the nasal turbinates.
 
### Q12	- LEARN
An 18-year-old _motorcycle accident victim_ is noted to have a fluctuating Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and a dilated right pupil in the Emergency Department. You suspect an extradural haemorrhage and this is confirmed on computed tomography. Which one of the following _branches of the maxillary artery_ is classically injured in an _extradural haemorrhage_?

	A. Deep auricular
	B. Anterior tympanic
	C. Middle meningeal
	D. Deep temporal
	E. Accessory meningeal

#### Answer: C. Middle meningeal - TRUE
- The middle meningeal artery is classically injured in extradural haemorrhage. Such injuries usually result from a fracture of the squamous part of the temporal bone and require burr holes to drain the blood. Other types of haemorrhage include subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhages.
 
- Subdural haematomas usually result from torn bridging veins or venous sinuses and are most commonly found in the elderly as a result of age-related cerebral atrophy and subsequent vulnerability of the bridging veins. Treatment involves drainage of the blood through burr holes, similar to the treatment of extradural haemorrhage.
 
- Subarachnoid haemorrhage can result from trauma or can occur spontaneously from a ruptured berry aneurysm, resulting in blood within the ventricular system. Treatment includes coiling or clipping of aneurysms in addition to rest, supportive fluids, nimodipine therapy and analgesia. Occasionally, an external ventricular drain might be required to drain blood from within the ventricular system and prevent hydrocephalus.
 
### Q13	
A patient of yours requires _central venous access_ via the _internal jugular vein_ (IJV). The internal jugular vein is formed by the union of the _sigmoid sinus_ with which one of the following sinuses?

	A. Superior petrosal sinus
	B. Inferior petrosal sinus
	C. Cavernous sinus
	D. Straight sinus
	E. Occipital sinus

#### Answer: C. Cavernous sinus - *FALSE* = B. Inferior petrosal sinus - TRUE
- The straight sinus usually runs into the left transverse sinus, which can also drain into the occipital and superior petrosal sinuses. The cavernous sinus receives drainage from the ophthalmic veins, sphenoparietal sinus, superficial middle cerebral vein and the basilar plexus. Subsequent drainage of the cavernous sinus is into the inferior petrosal sinus, although a large connection still exists to the superior petrosal sinus, running along the superior edge of the petrous temporal bone.
- The superior sagittal sinus runs in the upper border of the falx cerebri and runs posteriorly to the internal occipital protuberance, where it usually deviates to the right to become continuous with the corresponding transverse sinus. The inferior sagittal sinus lies in the free lower margin of the falx cerebri. It joins the great cerebral vein to become the straight sinus, which usually becomes continuous with the left transverse sinus. The sigmoid sinus is continuous with the transverse sinus.
 
- The petrosal sinuses drain the cavernous sinus. The superior petrosal sinus drains to the transverse sinus and the inferior petrosal sinus to the internal jugular vein.
- The internal jugular vein is formed by the union of the inferior petrosal sinus and the sigmoid sinus on each side of the skull base, to emerge from the jugular foramen and run down caudally within the carotid sheath.
 
### Q14	
All of the following statements about _5-fluorouracil_ (5-FU) are correct, EXCEPT:

	A. It is indicated in the adjuvant treatment of rectal cancers - T
	B. It interferes with DNA synthesis by reducing the availability of thymidylic acid - T
	C. It is used in the treatment of solid cancers - T
	D. It is an alkylating agent - FALSE
	E. It inhibits pyrimidine rather than purine synthesis - T

#### Answer: B. It interferes with DNA synthesis by reducing the availability of thymidylic acid - *FALSE* = D. It is an alkylating agent - TRUE
- 5-FU is commonly used in the treatment of colorectal cancers
- It belongs to the group of antimetabolites and 
	- inhibits DNA synthesis accordingly by interfering with pyrimidine synthesis
 
### Q15	
Which statement is true regarding the _bladder_?

	A. Sympathetic fibres cause relaxation of the detrusor muscle and contraction of the internal sphincter 
	B. In the male, the external sphincter lies above the prostate - F
	C. It receives its blood supply from branches of the external iliac arteries - F
	D. It is entirely covered by peritoneum - F
	E. The trigone is situated at the apex of the bladder

#### Answer: A. Sympathetic fibres cause relaxation of the detrusor muscle and contraction of the internal sphincter - TRUE
- The bladder is covered only on its upper aspect by peritoneum. Its muscular wall is formed by the detrusor muscle and it is lined by transitional epithelium. The triangular-shaped area at the bladder base, which lies between the two ureteric orifices, is the trigone. The detrusor muscle is supplied by parasympathetic fibres, which cause contraction, and sympathetic fibres, which cause relaxation. It has an internal sphincter formed by smooth muscle and an external sphincter, which lies below the prostate in the male. The blood supply comes from the superior and inferior vesical arteries, which are branches of the internal iliac artery.
 
### Q16	- LEARN

	A. Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)
	B. Vagus nerve (CN X)
	C. (Spinal) Accessory nerve (CN XI)
	D. Sigmoid sinus
	E. Superior petrosal sinus

#### Answer: B. Vagus nerve (CN X) - *FALSE* = E. Superior petrosal sinus - TRUE

Foramen			| Structures														|
----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
Ovale			| Mandibular division of trigeminal nerve (Vc)
				| Lesser petrosal nerve
				| Accessory meningeal arteries
Spinosum		| Middle meningeal vessels

Stylomastoid	| Facial nerve (VII)
Jugular			| Internal jugular vein from sigmoid and inferior petrosal sinuses
				| Cranial nerves IX, X and XI

**Notes**
- The sigmoid and inferior petrosal sinuses enter the jugular foramen to combine and form the internal jugular vein, which exits the foramen and runs caudally within the carotid sheath
- Cranial nerves IX, X and XI enter the foramen along with the sinuses and then course in their respective ways with only the vagus nerve continuing posterolaterally to the internal jugular vein within the carotid sheath
