	A. L3
	B. L4
	C. L5
	D. S1
	E. S2

#### Answer: C. L5 - *FALSE* = B. L4 - TRUE
- L4 dermatome supplies the sensation of the medial leg from the knee down to the medial aspect of the big toe
- L3 primarily supplies the superior knee and medial thigh region
- L5 supplies the lateral leg
- S1 the lateral foot and heel
 
### Q5	
All of the following are complications of _transurethral resection of prostate_ (TURP), EXCEPT:

	A. Urethral stricture - T
	B. Retrograde ejaculation - T
	C. HyPERnatraemia - F
	D. Incontinence - T
	E. Increased risk of myocardial infarction

#### Answer: E. Increased risk of myocardial infarction - *FALSE* = C. HyPERnatraemia - TRUE
- TURP is performed by passing a resectoscope through the urethra into the bladder and using a wire loop to pass electrical current to resect the prostate gland. It is a relatively safe procedure (mortality <0.25%) but is associated with certain complications. These include urinary incontinence (2–4%), erectile dysfunction (5%), urethral stricture (5%), retrograde ejaculation (65%) and increase risk of MI. In addition there is the risk of developing TUR syndrome, which is due to the absorption of irrigation fluid into the body. This presents with hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting and collapse. Blood tests show hyponatraemia.
 
### Q6	
Which of the following _muscles of mastication_ inserts into the _neck of the mandible_ and _anterior surface of the disc_ of the temporomandibular joint?

	A. Lateral pterygoid
	B. Medial pterygoid
	C. Masseter - F
	D. Buccinator - F
	E. Temporalis - F

#### Answer: A. Lateral pterygoid - TRUE
- Muscles of mastication include the lateral and medial pterygoids, the masseter muscle and the temporalis muscle. The buccinator muscle is a muscle of facial expression and not a mastication muscle. All of the muscles of mastication are supplied by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. Buccinator is supplied by the facial nerve.
 
- The lateral pterygoid arises as two heads from the lateral aspect of the lateral pterygoid plate and inserts into the neck of the mandible and the anterior surface of the disc of the temporomandibular joint. The medial pterygoid arises from the medial aspect of the lateral pterygoid plate and a small tubercle of the maxilla and its fibres insert inferolaterally into the roughened medial surface of the mandible near the angle.

- The temporalis muscle arises from the temporal fossa and inserts into the coronoid process of the mandible. The masseter arises from the anterior two-thirds of the lower border of the zygomatic arch as well as the posterior third of the lower border and the whole of the deep surface of the arch. It then inserts into the outer surface of the ramus of the mandible from the mandibular notch above, down to the angle of the mandible. Both temporalis and masseter are palpable on the facial examination as superficial muscles.
 
### Q7 - LEARN
Which one of these _muscle and nerve pairings_ is correct?

	A. Stylopharyngeus – glossopharyngeal nerve
	B. Tensor veli palatini – pharyngeal plexus - F
	C. Buccinator – cranial nerve Vc - F
	D. Palatoglossus – hypoglossal nerve - F
	E. Cricothyroid – recurrent laryngeal nerve - F

#### Answer: C. Buccinator – cranial nerve Vc - *FALSE* = A. Stylopharyngeus – glossopharyngeal nerve - TRUE
- There are a few simple rules for muscle innervation. All pharyngeal and palatal muscles are supplied by the pharyngeal plexus (IX, X and sympathetics), except stylopharyngeus, which is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) and tensor veli palatini, which is supplied by the nerve to the medial pterygoid (Vc). All tongue muscles are supplied by the hypoglossal nerve (XII), except palatoglossus, which is supplied by the pharyngeal plexus. Muscles of facial expression are supplied by the facial nerve (VII), except levator palpabrae superioris, which is supplied by the oculomotor nerve (III). Muscles of mastication are supplied by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (Vc), except buccinator, which is supplied by the facial nerve. Laryngeal muscles are supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (X), except cricothyroid, which is supplied by the superior laryngeal nerve (X).
 
### Q8	
Concerning _parasympathetic nerve supply_, which one of the following pairings is correct?

	A. Otic ganglion – submandibular gland
	B. Pterygopalatine ganglion – lacrimal gland
	C. Pterygopalatine ganglion – parotid gland - F
	D. Auriculotemporal nerve – submandibular gland - F
	E. Facial nerve – otic ganglion - F

#### Answer: B. Pterygopalatine ganglion – lacrimal gland - TRUE
- Parasympathetic supply arises from cranial nerves III, VII, IX and X. Oculomotor fibres (CN III, Edinger–Westphal nucleus) pass to the ciliary ganglion before supplying pupillary constriction and accommodation. Facial fibres (CN VII, superior salivary nucleus), via the nervus intermedius and greater petrosal nerve, pass to the pterygopalatine and submandibular ganglion, supplying the lacrimal, submandibular, sublingual and palatine glands. Glossopharyngeal fibres (CN IX, inferior salivary nucleus) run via the lesser petrosal to the otic ganglion and then in the auriculotemporal nerve to the parotid gland. Vagus fibres (CN X, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus) pass to the thorax and abdomen.
 
### Q9
A patient arrives in the Emergency Department with the following arterial blood gas results: PaO2 8.0 kPa; PaCO2 2.0 kPa; pH 7.54; bicarbonate 18 mmol/l. The most likely cause is:

	A. Excessive vomiting
	B. Pulmonary embolus (PE) - F
	C. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - F
	D. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA) - ?
	E. Chest wall trauma - F

#### Answer: A. Excessive vomiting - *FALSE* = B. Pulmonary embolus (PE)
- The example shows a patient with low PaO2, low PaCO2, high pH and low bicarbonate. When PaCO2 is low, it shifts the following equilibrium to the left
	- CO2 + H2O <> H2CO3 < > H+ + HCO3–
therefore reducing the concentration of H+ and causing a respiratory alkalosis
- From the given examples, PE is the most likely cause
	- this results in hyperventilation, which ‘blows off’ and therefore reduces blood levels of CO2 
	- but at the same time **fails to achieve satisfactory oxygenation**
 
### Q10 - LEARN	
The operation of choice for treatment of a _strangulated femoral hernia_, which is likely to contain _infarcted small bowel_ is:

	A. McEvedy’s abdominal approach
	B. Lothiessen’s high approach
	C. Lockwood’s crural or low approach
	D. Bassini’s low repair
	E. Lower midline laparotomy

#### Answer: A. McEvedy’s abdominal approach - TRUE
- The abdominal approach is best reserved where bowel resection is contemplated
- An inguinal or high approach is used to repair co-existing inguinal hernias or where the diagnosis is in doubt
- For small uncomplicated femoral hernias in the elective setting, the low or crural approach is preferable


Questions 11-20

??% = F: 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20

### Q11 - LEARN
A 21-year-old medical student presents to the Emergency Department with conjunctivitis. You prescribe him eye drops, but he mentions that he dislikes taking them as he gets a bitter taste at the back of his throat. You explain that the lacrimal drainage is connected to the nasopharynx, hence the bitter taste. He wishes to know exactly where the drainage occurs. 

Within the lateral wall of the nasal cavity the _nasolacrimal duct_ opens at the:

	A. Superior meatus - F
	B. Middle meatus - F
	C. Inferior meatus
	D. Spheno-ethmoidal recess 
	E. Nasopharynx - F

#### Answer: D. Spheno-ethmoidal recess - *FALSE* = C. Inferior meatus - TRUE
- The nasolacrimal duct enters the nasal cavity under the anterior lip of the inferior concha in the inferior meatus and connects the conjunctival sac to the nasal cavity for drainage of tears. The frontal sinus, anterior and middle ethmoidal sinuses and the maxillary sinus open into the middle meatus under the middle concha at the hiatus semilunaris. The posterior ethmoidal sinus opens into the superior meatus and the sphenoidal sinus onto the sphenoethmoidal recess. The opening of the pharyngotympanic tube, which is bounded by salpingopharyngeus, opens into the nasopharynx posterior to all the nasal turbinates.
 
### Q12	- LEARN
An 18-year-old _motorcycle accident victim_ is noted to have a fluctuating Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and a dilated right pupil in the Emergency Department. You suspect an extradural haemorrhage and this is confirmed on computed tomography. Which one of the following _branches of the maxillary artery_ is classically injured in an _extradural haemorrhage_?

	A. Deep auricular
	B. Anterior tympanic
	C. Middle meningeal
	D. Deep temporal
	E. Accessory meningeal

#### Answer: C. Middle meningeal - TRUE
- The middle meningeal artery is classically injured in extradural haemorrhage. Such injuries usually result from a fracture of the squamous part of the temporal bone and require burr holes to drain the blood. Other types of haemorrhage include subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhages.
 
- Subdural haematomas usually result from torn bridging veins or venous sinuses and are most commonly found in the elderly as a result of age-related cerebral atrophy and subsequent vulnerability of the bridging veins. Treatment involves drainage of the blood through burr holes, similar to the treatment of extradural haemorrhage.
 
- Subarachnoid haemorrhage can result from trauma or can occur spontaneously from a ruptured berry aneurysm, resulting in blood within the ventricular system. Treatment includes coiling or clipping of aneurysms in addition to rest, supportive fluids, nimodipine therapy and analgesia. Occasionally, an external ventricular drain might be required to drain blood from within the ventricular system and prevent hydrocephalus.
 
### Q13	
A patient of yours requires _central venous access_ via the _internal jugular vein_ (IJV). The internal jugular vein is formed by the union of the _sigmoid sinus_ with which one of the following sinuses?

	A. Superior petrosal sinus
	B. Inferior petrosal sinus
	C. Cavernous sinus
	D. Straight sinus
	E. Occipital sinus

#### Answer: C. Cavernous sinus - *FALSE* = B. Inferior petrosal sinus - TRUE
- The straight sinus usually runs into the left transverse sinus, which can also drain into the occipital and superior petrosal sinuses. The cavernous sinus receives drainage from the ophthalmic veins, sphenoparietal sinus, superficial middle cerebral vein and the basilar plexus. Subsequent drainage of the cavernous sinus is into the inferior petrosal sinus, although a large connection still exists to the superior petrosal sinus, running along the superior edge of the petrous temporal bone.
- The superior sagittal sinus runs in the upper border of the falx cerebri and runs posteriorly to the internal occipital protuberance, where it usually deviates to the right to become continuous with the corresponding transverse sinus. The inferior sagittal sinus lies in the free lower margin of the falx cerebri. It joins the great cerebral vein to become the straight sinus, which usually becomes continuous with the left transverse sinus. The sigmoid sinus is continuous with the transverse sinus.
 
- The petrosal sinuses drain the cavernous sinus. The superior petrosal sinus drains to the transverse sinus and the inferior petrosal sinus to the internal jugular vein.
- The internal jugular vein is formed by the union of the inferior petrosal sinus and the sigmoid sinus on each side of the skull base, to emerge from the jugular foramen and run down caudally within the carotid sheath.
 
### Q14	
All of the following statements about _5-fluorouracil_ (5-FU) are correct, EXCEPT:

	A. It is indicated in the adjuvant treatment of rectal cancers - T
	B. It interferes with DNA synthesis by reducing the availability of thymidylic acid - T
	C. It is used in the treatment of solid cancers - T
	D. It is an alkylating agent - FALSE
	E. It inhibits pyrimidine rather than purine synthesis - T

#### Answer: B. It interferes with DNA synthesis by reducing the availability of thymidylic acid - *FALSE* = D. It is an alkylating agent - TRUE
- 5-FU is commonly used in the treatment of colorectal cancers
- It belongs to the group of antimetabolites and 
	- inhibits DNA synthesis accordingly by interfering with pyrimidine synthesis
 
### Q15	
Which statement is true regarding the _bladder_?

	A. Sympathetic fibres cause relaxation of the detrusor muscle and contraction of the internal sphincter 
	B. In the male, the external sphincter lies above the prostate - F
	C. It receives its blood supply from branches of the external iliac arteries - F
	D. It is entirely covered by peritoneum - F
	E. The trigone is situated at the apex of the bladder

#### Answer: A. Sympathetic fibres cause relaxation of the detrusor muscle and contraction of the internal sphincter - TRUE
- The bladder is covered only on its upper aspect by peritoneum. Its muscular wall is formed by the detrusor muscle and it is lined by transitional epithelium. The triangular-shaped area at the bladder base, which lies between the two ureteric orifices, is the trigone. The detrusor muscle is supplied by parasympathetic fibres, which cause contraction, and sympathetic fibres, which cause relaxation. It has an internal sphincter formed by smooth muscle and an external sphincter, which lies below the prostate in the male. The blood supply comes from the superior and inferior vesical arteries, which are branches of the internal iliac artery.
 
### Q16	- LEARN

	D. Middle meningeal artery - F
	E. Facial nerve

#### Answer: B. Maxillary division of the trigeminal (CN Vb) - TRUE
 
### Q17	- LEARN
Structures entering through the _jugular foramen_ in the base of the skull include all of the following, EXCEPT:

	A. Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX)
	B. Vagus nerve (CN X)
	C. (Spinal) Accessory nerve (CN XI)
	D. Sigmoid sinus
	E. Superior petrosal sinus

#### Answer: B. Vagus nerve (CN X) - *FALSE* = E. Superior petrosal sinus - TRUE

Foramen			| Structures														|
----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
Ovale			| Mandibular division of trigeminal nerve (Vc)
				| Lesser petrosal nerve
				| Accessory meningeal arteries
Spinosum		| Middle meningeal vessels
				| Meningeal branch of Mandibular nerve
Rotundum		| Maxillary division of trigeminal nerve (Vb)
Stylomastoid	| Facial nerve (VII)
Jugular			| Internal jugular vein from sigmoid and inferior petrosal sinuses
				| Cranial nerves IX, X and XI

**Notes**
- The sigmoid and inferior petrosal sinuses enter the jugular foramen to combine and form the internal jugular vein, which exits the foramen and runs caudally within the carotid sheath
- Cranial nerves IX, X and XI enter the foramen along with the sinuses and then course in their respective ways with only the vagus nerve continuing posterolaterally to the internal jugular vein within the carotid sheath

	A. Lateral thigh region
	B. Posterior thigh
	C. Lateral thigh
	D. Medial thigh
	E. Groin area
#### Answer: A. Lateral thigh region - TRUE (Greek: 'meros' = thigh; 'algos' = pain)
- Meralgia paraesthetica refers to compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve as it passes through or just under the inguinal ligament, just medial to the anterior superior iliac spine
- Compression of the nerve results in symptoms in the anteromedial thigh region
 
### Q20

### Q21 - LEARN
A patient has a tuning fork test with central vertex placement localising to the left ear; left ear bone conduction is better than air conduction on left mastoid tuning fork placement. The right ear demonstrates better air than bone conduction. Which one of the following statements is TRUE?

	A. Weber’s test is positive in the left ear - F
	B. There is sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear
	C. Rinne’s test involves central tuning fork placement on the vertex of the skull - F
	D. There is a conductive loss of greater than 20 dB in the left ear - F
	E. Masking can be achieved with a Baroness sound box - ?

#### Answer: B. There is sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear - *FALSE* = D. There is a conductive loss of greater than 20 dB in the left ear - TRUE
- Weber’s test involves localising sound to one or other ear (signifies a 10-dB difference between the ears) or to the midline and involves central tuning fork placement, commonly on the vertex of the skull. Rinne’s test is conducted by comparing air conduction with bone conduction on the mastoid bone, signifying a conduction loss of greater than 20 dB. A positive Rinne’s test is one in which air conduction is better than bony conduction, signifying either a normal ear or sensorineural loss on that side. This patient has a Weber localising to the left, with a left negative and a right positive Rinne’s test. This is consistent with a conductive loss on the left. Masking can be achieved with a Barany sound box (not Baroness).

### Q28	
A 52-year-old businessman is admitted to the Emergency Department with acute-onset chest pain, which radiates to the right arm and is associated with nausea and sweating. An ECG taken shows ischaemic changes within the heart and you suspect that he has angina. Transmission of activity within which of the following _afferent nerves_ would explain the _pain radiating down the arm_ from the chest?

	A. Phrenic nerve
	B. Vagus nerve
	C. Somatic nerves to the arm - F
	D. Intercostal nerves - F
	E. Splanchnic nerves

#### Answer: B. Vagus nerve - *FALSE* = E. Splanchnic nerves - TRUE
- Pain arising from the heart travels within visceral afferent nerve fibres
	- which can run within the upper thoracic splanchnic nerves to reach the sympathetic chain, or
	- within the middle and inferior cardiac cervical nerves to reach the sympathetic chain 
		- and then further onto T1–T2 levels
 
### Q29	
A 42-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of intermittent, sudden-onset, dizzy spells. She describes the _world spinning suddenly_, where she feels she is being thrown to the floor. She _feels nauseous_ and lies as still as possible. It lasts for a few hours, and is associated with a _ringing in her ears_. She also notes that her hearing has slightly decreased between the attacks. Examination is unremarkable, but audiograms show low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

	A. Benign positional vertigo
	B. Acute labyrinthitis
	C. Acoustic neuroma
	D. Cardiovascular pathology
	E. Ménière’s disease

#### Answer: E. Ménière’s disease - TRUE
- This is a classic history of Ménière’s disease
	- comprising paroxysmal vertigo with fluctuating hearing loss and tinnitus
	- attacks lasting minutes to hours
- Benign positional vertigo is typified by vertigo associated with head movements lasting a few seconds to minutes
- Acute vestibular failure (acute labyrinthitis) gives rise to vertigo that lasts for days
	- often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection. Acoustic neuroma very rarely causes vertigo
- Cardiovascular pathology can lead to pre-syncope, with light-headedness but not usually vertigo

40% = F: 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 40

### Q31
Regarding TSH:

	A. Low levels of circulating T4 increase the TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)
	B. TSH secretion is diurnal, peaking around midday
	C. Plasma levels of TSH rise in hot environments - F
	D. Glucocorticoids and oestrogens reduce the TSH secretory response to TRH
	E. Secretion is stimulated by somatostatin and dopamine - F

#### Answer: B. TSH secretion is diurnal, peaking around midday - *FALSE* = A. Low levels of circulating T4 increase the TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) - TRUE
- The synthesis depends on an adequate supply of dietary iodine (at least 75 μg daily is required to prevent goitre formation). Thyroid hormones, like catecholamines, are synthesised from the amino acid tyrosine. The synthesis of iodine requires the iodination of two tyrosine molecules and combination of two iodinated tyrosine residues. The iodine is reduced to iodide before absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Follicular cells have an active iodide pump that acquires and concentrates iodide from the blood against an electrochemical gradient of more than 50 mV (inside negative). Iodide is rapidly oxidised by a peroxidase enzyme to iodine and incorporated into tyrosyl residues in thyroglobulin, which is located in the colloid. The multiple tyrosyl units on the thyroglobulin are iodinated at either one or two positions, forming mono-iodotyrosine (MIT) and di-iodotyrosine (DIT). When MIT couples with DIT it forms T3, and two DIT molecules form T4 of thyroxine. Thiouracils block the enzyme peroxidase and are very useful in treating states of thyroid hyperfunction. TSH has no effect on iodide traps in salivary glands, breast, placenta, cilary body or gastric mucosa.

- The thyroid gland is controlled by hormone secretions from the hypothalamus–pituitary axis. The synthesis and secretion of TSH from the thyrotrophs is stimulated by TRH. TSH secretion is inhibited by other hormones including somatostatin and dopamine and also cytokines, particularly IL-1β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF). TSH is a complex glycoprotein hormone, and there are structural similarities between TSH, LH and FSH and a half-life of about 1 hour.
 
- When circulating levels of T4 are low, there is an increase in the number of TRH receptors and in TSH synthesis, resulting in an increased TSH response to TRH. The reverse is true in the presence of high circulating levels of thyroid hormones.
 
- TSH is secreted in a pulsatile fashion with a diurnal variation, peaking around midnight. Cold weather will lead to an increase in the plasma concentrations of thyroid hormones, with a subsequent rise in basal metabolic rate. Glucocorticoids inhibit thyroid hormone secretions by reducing the TSH secretory response to TRH; oestrogens have the opposite effect.

### Q34	- LEARN
Regarding multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes, which one of the following statements is correct?

	A. Pituitary adenomas are mainly a feature of MEN II - F
	B. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is a feature of MEN II
	C. Phaeochromocytomas are best detected by urinary 5-HIAA measurement - F
	D. MEN syndromes are always familial - F
	E. Parathyroid adenomas tend to present with hypocalcaemia - F

#### Answer: B. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is a feature of MEN II - TRUE
- Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes are subdivided into types I and II. MEN I is characterised by pituitary adenomas, parathyroid adenomas and pancreatic endocrine tumours (eg insulinomas, gastrinomas, VIPomas). MEN II is characterised by medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, parathyroid adenomas and phaeochromocytomas. MEN IIB is a variant of this and is also associated with an appearance suggestive of Marfan syndrome. Phaeochomocytomas are usually tested for by measuring urinary VMA (vanillyl-mandelic acid). Raised urinary 5-HIAA is usually associated with carcinoid syndrome. Although MEN syndromes can show a genetic predisposition, most are due to sporadic mutations. Parathyroid adenomas can (but do not always) present with hypercalcaemia.
 
### Q35	
The _sensory nerve_ supply to the _diaphragmatic pleura_ is derived from the:

	A. Phrenic nerve
	B. Vagus nerve - F
	C. Intercostal nerve
	D. Sympathetic chain - F
	E. Pectoral nerves - F

#### Answer: C. Intercostal nerve - *FALSE* = A. Phrenic nerve - TRUE
- The phrenic nerve is derived from the roots of C3, C4, and C5 and is the only motor supply to the diaphragm. It is also involved in the sensory supply of the diaphragmatic parietal pleura, the mediastinal parietal pleura, as well as the diaphragmatic peritoneum. The vagus (CN X, parasympathetic) supplies the visceral pleura and is only sensitive to stretch, in contrast to the parietal pleura, which is sensitive to pain. The intercostal nerves supply sensation to the costal pleura. There is no sympathetic nerve supply to the pleura, although within the lungs it is involved in bronchodilation. The pectoral nerves are derived from the brachial plexus and supply the pectoralis muscles.
 
### Q36 - LEARN	
The _intervertebral joint_ is an example of a:

	A. Primary cartilaginous joint
	B. Secondary cartilaginous joint
	C. Fibrous joint - F
	D. Synovial condyloid joint - F
	E. Synovial plane

#### Answer: B. Secondary cartilaginous joint - TRUE
- The intervertebral joints are an example of a secondary cartilaginous joint. This variety of joint occurs conveniently along the midline of the axial skeleton. Other examples include the manubriosternal and xiphisternal joints and the symphysis pubis. Structurally, they are similar to primary cartilaginous joints, except they also have a disc of fibrocartilage between the hyaline layers.

**Notes** 
- Fibrous joints are formed when two bones meet with fibrous tissue in-between. Examples include the teeth, skull sutures and interosseous membranes between the limb bones.
- Synovial joints are joint cavities that are lined by a synovial membrane and contain synovial fluid for movement. They are seen in all joints which perform movements.
 
### Q37	
Which of the following blood results is most likely to indicate _recent infection with hepatitis B_?

Option	| HBsAg	| HBeAg	| Anti-HBsAg	| Anti-HBcAg	|
--------|:-----:|:-----:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
A		| -		| -		| +				| +				|
B		| -		| +		| -				| +				|
C		| +		| -		| +				| -				|
D		| +		| +		| -				| +				|
E		| +		| +		| +				| +				|
 
#### Answer: C: HBsAg +; HBeAg -; Anti-HBsAg +; Anti-HBcAg -; - *FALSE* D: HBsAg +; **HBeAg +**; **Anti-HBsAg -**; Anti-HBcAg -;
- Hepatitis B is a hepadnavirus, which is a DNA virus. In the acute phase of infection, the virus releases its surface antigen (HBsAg) into the blood. This is also found to be present in persistent/chronic infections. The core antigen (HBcAg) causes production of HBc antibodies, which are the first antibodies to occur in the course of the infection. It is present in the blood in the brief period when HBsAg disappears and before Hbs antibodies appear, and thus it is an important diagnostic indicator of early infection. HBsAb confers immunity to the HBV virus. The ‘e’ antigen (HBeAg) is also found in the core of the virus and its presence in the blood indicates active viral production and infection. The antibody against HBeAG (HBeAb) is found at a much later stage of infection.

	C. Sartorius - T
	D. Quadratus femoris
	E. Tensor fascia lata - T

#### Answer: C. Sartorius - *FALSE* = D. Quadratus femoris - TRUE
- Quadratus femoris is a lateral rotator of the hip joint as it connects the lateral border of the ischial tuberosity to the quadrate tubercle of the femur
- All the others listed abduct the hip joint acting together
 
### Q40	
Which of the following _hereditary immune disorders_ is NOT correctly paired with the affected component of the immune system?

	A. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) – macrophages
	B. DiGeorge syndrome – T cells
	C. Leucocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) – neutrophils
	D. Hereditary angioedema – complement pathway
	E. X-linked hypogammaglobulinaemia – B cells

#### Answer: C. Leucocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) – *neutrophils* - *FALSE* = A. Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) – *macrophages* - TRUE
- CGD is an inherited deficiency in one subunit of NADPH oxidase used by phagocytes, thus causing patients to develop severe infections from bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella. DiGeorge syndrome is due to failure of development of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches and therefore results in development of a hypoplastic thymus causing T-cell deficiency. LAD is a result of defects in the β chain of β2 integrins, which are important for leucocyte movement. This results in recurrent infections from extracellular bacteria owing to defective opsonisation, adhesion mobility and chemotaxis. Hereditary angioedema is due to a defect in the C1 inhibitor, and X-linked hypogammaglobulinaemia is due to a block in the maturation of the B cell, which results in recurrent pyogenic infections.

### Q43	
A 28-year-old woman gives birth to a healthy baby girl in the delivery suite. During her second stage of labour an _episiotomy_ was necessary to allow delivery of her baby under local anaesthesia. Immediately after this procedure, the woman now complains that she is unable to maintain continence of faeces as she has no _voluntary control of her anal sphincters_. Which nerve in this clinical scenario has been anaesthetised?

	A. Pudendal nerve
	B. Inferior gluteal nerve
	C. Superior gluteal nerve
	D. Ventral rami of S3 and S4
	E. Inferior hypogastric nerve

#### Answer: A. Pudendal nerve - TRUE
- The pudendal nerve block can be useful in performing episiotomies. The pudendal nerve also supplies the external anal sphincters, thus rendering loss of faecal continence if it is anaesthetised. The inferior gluteal nerve supplies the gluteus maximus muscle and the superior gluteal nerve is motor supply to the gluteus medius and minimus as well as tensor fascia lata. The ventral rami of S3 and S4 are involved in supplying the levator ani muscle, which also contributes to the mechanism of continence, but in a more physiological mechanism via the puborectalis sling.

	- produced by Choroid Plexus 
	- absorbed by Arachnoid Granulations (villi) to return to venous system
 
### Q48	
A 42-year old alcoholic man is referred to you with ascites and liver cirrhosis. The mechanism of formation of ascites in this patient with cirrhosis is a combination of which of the following conditions?

	A. Hypoalbuminaemia and portal hypertension
	B. Decreased hepatic lymph flow
	C. Decreased hepatic lymph flow with decreased aldosterone secretion
	D. Leaky capillaries in the portal circulation
	E. Subacute inflammatory changes causing hepatic oedema and extravasation of fluid

#### Answer: A. Hypoalbuminaemia and portal hypertension - TRUE
- Ascites formation in cirrhosis is due to disruption of Starling’s forces within the abdominal circulation. The low protein (albumin) allows for a low oncotic pressure of fluid drawback into the portal circulation from the interstitial spaces and the venous hypertension also forces the outward hydrostatic pressure, equally contributing to ascitic formation. Spironolactone is useful in the treatment of ascites due to liver cirrhosis. This drug antagonises the effects of aldosterone, which is found in very high levels within the plasma due to its lack of metabolism in the cirrhotic liver.
 
### Q49	- LEARN
A woman is brought to the Emergency Department after being rescued from a house fire. She has burns affecting her left arm and anterior surfaces of both legs. Using Wallace’s rule of nines, the percentage of area burnt is:

	A. 45%
	B. 18%
	C. 36%
	D. 27%
	E. 54%

#### Answer: D. 27% - TRUE (arm: 9%; leg: 1/2 x 18% x 2 = 18%; total: 27%)
- Wallace’s rule of nines is used to calculate the percentage body area involved
- It works by attributing a percentage to a body part: 
	Head = 9%; arm (each) = 9%; legs (each) 18% (9% each surface); trunk 36%; perineum 1%; palm 1.25%
- Calculating the percentage burn helps to guide fluid resuscitation
	- intravenous fluids are essential when this exceeds 15%
 
### Q50	
A 35-year old businessman presents to you for an endoscopy following symptoms of epigastric pain which is worse at nights and on eating food. You suspect a gastric ulcer and proceed to perform endoscopy with a biopsy for *Helicobacter pylori*. On endoscopic biopsy, which of the following is the commonest location for finding H. pylori within the stomach?

	A. Fundus
	B. Lesser curve
	C. Body
	D. Pyloric antrum
	E. Cardia

#### Answer: D. Pyloric antrum - TRUE
Acid is secreted from the parietal cells within the stomach under neurohormonal influence. The highest concentration of these cells within the stomach is found in the gastric antrum. Evidence-based research also reveals that the pyloric antrum is the commonest location for Helicobacter pylori within the stomach and it is this location that is always biopsied in searching for H. pylori.

### Q58	
Which of the following structures can be injured in _supracondylar fracture of the femur_?

	A. Sciatic nerve
	B. Popliteal artery
	C. Long saphenous vein
	D. Short saphenous vein
	E. Deep femoral artery

#### Answer: D. Short saphenous vein - *FALSE* = B. Popliteal artery - TRUE
- Supracondylar fractures of the femur jeopardise the popliteal neurovascular bundle, in particular the popliteal artery. The sciatic nerve divides into its two terminal branches above the popliteal fossa, and the deep femoral artery has only a few geniculate branches participating around the knee. The long and short saphenous veins are subcutaneous veins lying medial to the knee or inferior to the popliteal fossa respectively.

### Q59	
Which of the following is NOT a _complication of mechanical ventilation_?

	A. Pneumothorax - T
	B. Gastric dilatation
	C. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
	D. Atrophy of respiratory muscles - T
	E. Reduced venous return - T

#### Answer: C. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - TRUE
- Mechanical ventilation is used for unconscious patients and also to provide oxygen therapy where other methods have failed. It is unfortunately associated with several complications. As a result of the positive pressure required there is a risk of barotrauma (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum and surgical emphysema) and venous return is reduced, which decreases cardiac filling. Ventilation can also cause gastric dilatation and ileus, and long-term use can lead to atrophy of the respiratory muscles. Infection and airway damage are other risks.

Which of the following statements regarding the _triquetral bone_ is correct?

	A. The degree of contact with the radioulnar articular disc is maximal in full adduction of the wrist joint
	B. It lies just laterally to the lunate bone - F
	C. It forms part of the radiocarpal joint in the wrist - T
	D. The hamate lies just anterolaterally to the triquetral - F
	E. During forced hyperextension of the wrist joint, anterior dislocation of the triquetral can cause carpal tunnel syndrome - F

#### Answer: C. It forms part of the radiocarpal joint in the wrist - *FALSE* = A. The degree of contact with the radioulnar articular disc is maximal in full adduction of the wrist joint - TRUE
- Triquetral participates in ulnocarpal joint and articulates with triangular articular disc proximally
- Pisiform is related anteromedially and Hamate distally
- During forced hyperextension of Wrist Joint
	- Anterior dislocation of Lunate can cause a Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
 
### Q62	
A 23-year-old man undergoes open reduction and internal fixation of the right tibia after having sustained injuries from a road traffic accident. Shortly after his return to the ward, he begins to complain of paraesthesia in his toes as well as pain in his right leg, which is not relieved by analgesia. He has good distal pulses and sensation to his right foot. The first step in the management of this patient would be to:

	A. Measure his compartment pressures in the right leg
	B. Prescribe stronger analgesia as this is a common post-operative complaint - F
	C. Call your seniors as he may have a trapped nerve from the surgery
	D. Book theatres immediately for urgent fasciotomies as you are highly suspicious of compartment syndrome
	E. Split the cast to relieve any pressure from post-operative swelling and reassess the situation in 10 minutes

#### Answer: E. Split the cast to relieve any pressure from post-operative swelling and reassess the situation in 10 minutes - TRUE
- This patient has undergone an internal fixation of the tibia following a fracture. He is at very high risk of a compartment syndrome in that leg. He could well have a compartment syndrome, but this might also be caused by a tight cast among the causes already listed, such as fractures and surgery. The first step in this case is to split the plaster cast and dressing and relieve any pressure as well as elevate the leg and prescribe analgesia. This should resolve most of his symptoms. However, if shortly afterwards he continues to have signs and symptoms then compartment syndrome should be suspected. Urgent senior review with fasciotomies in theatre is the next step. Compartment pressure monitoring is an adjunct to the clinical scenario here.
 
### Q63	
Drainage of the _right testicular vein_ normally occurs into the:

	A. Portal vein
	B. Inferior vena cava
	C. Right renal vein
	D. Right internal iliac vein
	E. Right suprarenal vein

#### Answer: B. Inferior vena cava - TRUE
- Drainage of right testicular vein normally occurs into IVC and left testicular vein into left renal vein
- Both testicular arteries arise from the abdominal aorta and so lymphatic drainage is to para-aortic nodes
 
### Q64	
Which of these conditions does NOT predispose towards _acute sinusitis_?

	A. Immunocompromise - T
	B. Dental infection - T
	C. Nasal polyposis - T
	D. Kartagener syndrome - T
	E. Waardenberg syndrome

#### Answer: E. Waardenberg syndrome - TRUE
- Predisposing factors can be divided into local or general, the commonest causes being nasal. Any condition leading to blockage of the sinus ostia can lead to secretion retention and predisposition towards infection. Local causes can be due to upper respiratory tract infections, rhinitis, nasal polyps, tumours and foreign bodies, nasal anatomical variations, dental problems, swimming and diving and sinus fractures. 
- General causes are debilitation, immuno-compromise, mucociliary disorders (Kartagener syndrome, cystic fibrosis) and atmospheric pollutants (dust, fumes).
 
### Q65	- LEARN
Which of the following is NOT a feature of _acute respiratory distress syndrome_ (ARDS)?

	A. Severe hypoxaemia (PaO2/FiO2 <27) - T
	B. Pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray - T
	C. A known cause (eg pancreatitis) - T
	D. Cardiac pulmonary oedema
	E. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) <18 mmHg

#### Answer: E. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) <18 mmHg - *FALSE* = D. Cardiac pulmonary oedema - TRUE
- ARDS is a specific disease of the lungs characterised by hypoxaemia, alveolar inflammation and oedema and pulmonary fibrosis. Clinically the patient has a raised respiratory rate; cyanosis and arterial blood gases show hypercapnia. Lung compliance is greatly reduced, therefore increasing the work required. There are certain criteria that need to be met in order to make a diagnosis of ARDS. These are: severe hypoxaemia (PaO2/FiO2 of <27), pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray, pulmonary artery wedge pressure of <18 mmHg (therefore non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema) and a recognised cause. There are a variety of causes, including pancreatitis, sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), burns and aspiration.
 
### Q66	
A 43-year-old female patient has had a successful _kidney transplant_ and is being discharged on the 5th post-operative day. One of the instructions she was given was not to eat _grapefruit_ or drink grapefruit juice. This is because:

	A. Grapefruit juice has large amounts of potassium - F
	B. Grapefruit juice is sour and might interfere with the patient’s digestion - F
	C. Grapefruit juice can interfere with the metabolism of tacrolimus, one of the immunosuppressive agents being used
	D. Grapefruit juice can interact with the action of the statin that has been prescribed for her hypercholesterolaemia - F
	E. Grapefruit juice can cause diarrhoea and interfere with the patient’s fluid balance

#### Answer: C. Grapefruit juice can interfere with the metabolism of tacrolimus, one of the immunosuppressive agents being used - TRUE
- Drugs that interact with grapefruit and/or grapefruit juice undergo cytochrome p450 oxidative metabolism in the intestinal wall or liver. Grapefruit juice contains various furanocoumarins, which have been demonstrated to affect the cytochrome p450 system, especially at the isoenzyme CYP3A4. From the immunosuppressive agents, both ciclosporine and tacrolimus can show reduced metabolism with consumption of grapefruit juice, leading to toxic effects.
 
### Q67	- LEARN
Which of the following is NOT a _complication of tracheostomy_?

	A. Tracheal necrosis
	B. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
	C. Pneumothorax - T
	D. Hypothyroidism
	E. Tracheocutaneous fistula - T

#### Answer: B. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury - *TRUE* = D. Hypothyroidism - TRUE
 
##### Complications of Tracheostomy
1. Immediate
	- anaesthetic
	- damage to local structures (cricoid cartilage, recurrent laryngeal nerve, oesophagus, brachiocephalic vein
	- thyroid – not enough to cause hypothyroidism, mostly bleeding)
	- cardiac arrest 
	- primary haemorrhage
2. Intermediate
	- displacement of tube
	- surgical emphysema
	- pneumothorax
	- obstruction of tube
	- infection
	- tracheal necrosis
3. Late
	- subglottic/tracheal stenosis
	- decannulation difficulty
	- tracheocutaneous fistula
	- scar (hypertrophic, keloid)

### Q68	
A man presents to the Emergency Department with a _very low urine output_. Analysis of urine and serum samples gives the following results: urinary sodium 15 mmol/l; urine osmolality 520 mOsmol/kg; urine to serum osmolality ratio 1.5. The most likely cause is:

	A. Bilateral pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction
	B. Retention secondary to enlarged prostate
	C. Excessive diarrhoea and vomiting
	D. Interstitial nephritis
	E. Glomerulonephritis

#### Answer: C. Excessive diarrhoea and vomiting - TRUE
- The cause of oliguria can be determined by looking at urine and serum samples. This helps to differentiate between renal and pre-renal causes. Pre-renal renal failure will have low urinary sodium (<20 mmol/l) and a serum osmolality ratio of >1.2, serum creatinine ratio of >40 and a high urine osmolality of >500 mOsmol/kg. Conversely; renal causes have high urinary sodium of >40 mmol/l, serum osmolality ratio of <1.2, serum creatinine ratio <20 and an osmolality of <350 mOsmol/kg.
 
### Q69	
The most common site affected in _oral cavity carcinoma_ is:

	A. Hard palate - F
	B. Lateral border of the tongue
	C. Tonsils - F
	D. Buccal mucosa
	E. Soft palate - F

#### Answer: D. Buccal mucosa - *FALSE* = B. Lateral border of the tongue - TRUE
- Some 90% of malignant oral cavity tumours are squamous cell carcinomas, accounting for <2% of malignancies in the UK. The commonest site is the lateral border of the tongue, presenting as an ulcer or an exophytic lesion. 
- Aetiological factors include smoking and chewing tobacco, and high alcohol consumption
- Tonsils and soft palate are actually within the oropharynx, not the oral cavity
 
### Q70	
A 50-year-old woman is found to be _febrile_ one day after her _total gastrectomy_ for malignancy. The most likely cause of this is:

	A. Urinary tract infection
	B. Pulmonary embolus
	C. Wound infection
	D. Anastomotic leak
	E. Atelectasis

#### Answer: E. Atelectasis - TRUE
- The commonest cause of fever 1 day after upper gastrointestinal surgery is atelectasis from retained secretions in the small bronchi
- Urinary tract infections are usually catheter-related and take a few days to develop 
	- rather than occurring in the immediate postoperative period
- Pulmonary emboli develop from deep vein thromboses, which also take a few days to develop
- Anastomotic leaks are classically seen from day 5 onwards, as are wound infections

### Q71 - LEARN
Which of the following is NOT a test used to determine _brainstem death_?

	A. Corneal reflex - T
	B. Gag reflex - T
	C. Caloric test
	D. Pain reflex
	E. Flexor response

#### Answer: E. Flexor response - TRUE
- Brainstem death is defined as irreversible cessation of brainstem function and is diagnosed by carrying out specific tests. These tests cannot be carried out if the patient is hypothermic (<35 °C) has had depressant drugs or has metabolic derangements. The patient must be in an apnoeic coma requiring ventilation and have a known cause of brain damage. The tests are designed to test the cranial nerves and are: pupillary response, corneal reflex, pain reflex (facial nerve distribution), caloric test (instillation of ice-cold water into the ear, looking for nystagmus towards that side), gag reflex and apnoea test.
 
### Q72	
The following vessels all _supply blood to the oesophagus_, EXCEPT:

	A. Inferior thyroid artery - T
	B. Inferior phrenic artery - T
	C. Left gastric artery branches - T
	D. Superior phrenic artery
	E. Aortic and bronchial branches - T

#### Answer: A. Inferior thyroid artery - *FALSE* = D. Superior phrenic artery - TRUE
- The blood supply to the oesophagus is classically divided into thirds. The upper third is supplied by branches of the inferior thyroid artery, the middle third from aortic oesophageal branches, and the lower third mainly from the left gastric artery, although contributions from the inferior phrenic are also received. The pericardiophrenic arterial branch of the internal thoracic acts as the superior diaphragmatic supply, but does not contribute branches to the oesophagus.
 
### Q73	
_High anal fistulae_:

	A. Are more common than low anal fistulae - F
	B. Open into the rectum above the puborectalis muscle
	C. Can be managed with a loose seton - F
	D. Are typically associated with ulcerative colitis - F
	E. May be laid open without hazard - F

#### Answer: B. Open into the rectum above the puborectalis muscle - *FALSE* = C. Can be managed with a loose seton - TRUE
- High anal fistulae can be difficult to manage as their treatment can involve dividing the anal sphincters
- A loose seton helps establish drainage of sepsis
	- great importance as the first step in managing any anal fistula
- **NOTE** High fistulae are seen in Crohn’s disease rather than ulcerative colitis
 
### Q74 - LEARN	
Which of the following is NOT used in the definition of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)?

	A. Temperature >39 °C - T
	B. Tachycardia >90 bpm - T
	C. Temperature <36 °C - T
	D. Bradycardia <45 bpm
	E. PaCO2 <4.3 kPa

#### Answer: D. Bradycardia <45 bpm - TRUE
- SIRS involves the systemic activation of the acute-phase response following an insult
- SIRS is defined by the presence of two or more of the following
	1. Tachycardia: >90 bpm
	2. Respiratory rate: >20 bpm **or** PaCO2 of <4.3 kPa
	3. Temperature: < 36°C or > 38°C

### Q75	
The _developmental origin_ of the _uterus and uterine tubes_ is the:

	A. Pronephric ducts
	B. Mesonephric ducts
	C. Metanephric ducts
	D. Paramesonephric ducts
	E. Wolffian ducts

#### Answer: E. Wolffian ducts - *FALSE* = D. Paramesonephric ducts - TRUE
- Pronephros – develops in the third week but never develops fully
- Mesonephric ducts – develop in males to form vas deferens and epididymis; also known as the Wolffian ducts
- Metanephric ducts – develop into the ureter, pelvis, calyces and collecting tubule
- **Paramesonephric ducts** – rise parallel to mesonephric ducts to form the uterus and uterine tubes

### Q76	
_High-output stomas_ are associated with all of the following, EXCEPT:

	A. Distal position
	B. Electrolyte disturbances - T
	C. Diarrhoea - T
	D. Octreotide to reduce output
	E. Loperamide to reduce output

#### Answer: A. Distal position - TRUE
- Proximal stomas, such as jejunostomies for example, are associated with very high outputs because of the increased secretions from the gastroinstestinal tract and pancreaticobiliary enzymes
- The more distal position allows these fluids, along with most of the oral intake, to be digested and absorbed to a greater degree, so there is less stoma output

**NOTE** Proximal stomas can be associated with dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities and renal failure
 
### Q77	
A 57-year-old man was admitted to Neurointensive Care after a subarachnoid haemorrhage. He is not brainstem-dead, but the neurosurgeon is of the opinion that further treatment is futile. His long-standing partner of 15 years, a 55-year-old man, is in agreement that treatment should be withdrawn. Which of the following statements is TRUE?

	A. The patient cannot be a kidney donor because he is gay - F
	B. The patient cannot be a kidney donor because he is not brainstem-dead - F
	C. The patient cannot be a donor because he is too old - F
	D. The patient is a potential non-heart-beating donor of his liver and kidneys
	E. Organ retrieval from such a patient is illegal - F

#### Answer: D. The patient is a potential non-heart-beating donor of his liver and kidneys - TRUE
- A gay patient who has been in a long and stable relationship can be an organ donor; he is probably a lower risk group than, say, a young promiscuous heterosexual. Organ donation after cardiac death from withdrawal of treatment is permissible. The patient is not necessarily too old to be a donor. It depends on what other co-morbidities are present. If he is a diabetic and/ or has long-standing hypertension and, at retrieval, the renal arteries show signs of heavy deposition of atheroma, then one is minded to turn down the kidneys for transplantation.
 
### Q78	
Concerning _laparoscopic surgery_, which of the following is NOT true?

	A. Shoulder-tip pain is a common post-operative complaint - T
	B. Bowel perforation should have consent - T
	C. Verres needles should be inserted under direct vision - F
	D. Conduction coupling is a recognised risk - T
	E. Pneumoperitoneum can lead to pneumomediastinum - T

#### Answer: C. Verres needles should be inserted under direct vision - TRUE
- Verres needles are designed to be inserted blind to establish a pneumoperitoneum
- Most surgeons do not recommend their use as it is a blind procedure 
	- Damage to viscera can occur, with a modest risk
- When employing the open (Hasson’s) approach, the dissection into the peritoneum 
	- Is much safer as it is done under direct vision
 
### Q79	
_Smoking_ causes all of the following _physiological effects_, EXCEPT:

	A. A shift of the oxygen dissociation curve to the left - F
	B. Impaired wound healing and increased risk of wound breakdown - T
	C. Impaired mucociliary function - T
	D. No change in cardiovascular function when stopped 1 day before surgery
	E. An increase in pulse rate and mean arterial pressure - T

#### Answer: A. A shift of the oxygen dissociation curve to the left - *FALSE* = D. No change in cardiovascular function when stopped 1 day before surgery - TRUE
- Sudden cessation in smoking causes a rebound tachycardia and hypertension, which is temporary and mostly resultant from the irritability and depression of cravings. Cardiovascular and respiratory function will improve long term and aid in recovery from surgery, anaesthesia and wound healing on stopping smoking. Effects are related to the volume and frequency of smoking for individual patients.

	A. Is prominent in atrial systole - F
	B. Is synchronous with the carotid pulse wave - F
	C. Reflects a rise in atrial pressure before the tricuspid valve opens - F
	D. Is due to the tricuspid valve moving down during ventricular systole - F
	E. Reflects opening of the tricuspid valve and a fall in right atrial pressure

#### Answer: E. Reflects opening of the tricuspid valve and a fall in right atrial pressure - *FALSE* = D. Is due to the tricuspid valve moving down during ventricular systole - TRUE

##### Jugular Venous Pressure (JVP)
- a wave: prominent in atrial systole
- c wave: synchronous with the carotid pulse wave
- v wave: reflects a rise in atrial pressure before the tricuspid valve opens
- **x descent**: due to the tricuspid valve moving down during ventricular systole
- y descent: reflects opening of tricuspid valve and a fall in right atrial pressure
 
### Q82	
During the lateral (Hardinge’s) approach to the hip, which one of the following nerves can be injured?

	A. Tibial
	B. Sciatic
	C. Inferior gluteal
	D. Superior gluteal
	E. Obturator

#### Answer: D. Superior gluteal - TRUE
- In the lateral approach, the skin and the fascia lata are incised to expose the gluteus medius and the vastus lateralis muscles. The gluteus medius is incised from the greater trochanter, leaving a cuff of tissue. This incision is extended to split the gluteus medius proximally, and distally the vastus is split along its anterior part down to the femoral shaft. The gluteus minimus is detached from its insertion and the hip is exposed after incising the joint capsule. The superior gluteal nerve can be damaged (and the gluteus medius denervated) if the gluteus medius is split >5 cm proximal to the greater trochanter.
 
### Q83	
A tumour marker used in surveillance after orchidectomy for nonseminomatous germ-cell tumours (NSGCT) of the testes is:

	A. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
	B. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
	C. CA-125
	D. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)
	E. CA-19-9

#### Answer: B. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) - TRUE
- Tumour markers are substances found in the blood that are associated with certain cancers. They are used in diagnosis, surveillance and staging. Nonseminomatous germ cell tumours of the testis are associated with a raised AFP and raised βhCG). PSA is a tumour marker for prostate cancer but is also elevated in benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and prostatitis. CA-125 is mainly elevated in mucinous ovarian carcinoma but is also seen in breast and pancreatic cancer. CEA is a marker for colorectal cancer, as well as ovarian and breast cancer. CA-19-9 is sometimes elevated in pancreatic cancer and advanced colorectal cancer.

	E. Conclusive diagnosis requires a muscle biopsy in addition to the clinical picture - T

#### Answer: A. Relatives of affected individuals should always be tested - *FALSE* = B. Inheritance is in an autosomal recessive pattern - TRUE
- Malignant hyperpyrexia is an **autosomal dominant** condition with an incidence of 1 in 200 000. It produces a hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle on exposure to general anaesthetics or muscle relaxants, which produces hyperthermia as a side effect. Muscle rigidity and rhabdomyolysis can occur, with resulting hyperkalaemia and multi-organ failure. Treatment is supportive, with intravenous fluids, dantrolene sodium, cooling, forced diuresis and intensive care as necessary.

	C. Activated macrophages that secrete proteases
	D. IgM and IgG antibodies
	E. Host-cell receptor modulation in response to toxins

#### Answer: C. Activated macrophages that secrete proteases - *FALSE* = D. IgM and IgG antibodies - TRUE
- Exotoxins are secreted by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
	- whereas endotoxins are found within cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria only
- The main defence against these secreted toxins are antibodies such as IgG and IgM
- *Clinical Example*: tetanus toxin and tetanus immunoglobulin injected to help counter its effects
 
### Q90	
The _inguinal canal_:

	A. Is approximately 2.5-cm long - F
	B. Has the fascia transversalis covering its whole posterior wall - F
	C. Has an internal ring lying 5 cm above the middle of the inguinal ligament - F
	D. Has the lacunar ligament in the medial part of its floor - F
	E. Has the inferior epigastric artery lying medial to its deep ring - T

#### Answer: E. Has the inferior epigastric artery lying medial to its deep ring - TRUE
- The deep ring of the inguinal canal is a defect in the transversalis fascia and is situated 2 cm above the midpoint of the inguinal ligament. It has the inferior epigastric artery on its medial aspect and it is this structure that is used to define Hasselbach’s triangle. Indirect inguinal hernias pass through the deep ring and are lateral to this vessel. Direct hernias, in contrast, pass through the posterior wall, medial to the inferior epigastric artery.

### Q91
All of the following statements regarding _interferons_ are correct, EXCEPT that they:

	A. Are induced by dsRNA - T
	B. Are typically specific to their host species cell of origin - T
	C. Appear typically before antibodies in viral infections - T
	D. Inhibit the growth of both DNA and RNA viruses - T
	E. Enhance the metabolism of infected cells

#### Answer: C. Appear typically before antibodies in viral infections - *FALSE* = E. Enhance the metabolism of infected cells - TRUE
- Interferons are a heterogeneous group of endogenous glycoproteins which inhibit the growth of viruses, bacteria, protozoa and cancer cells by blocking the translation of proteins. They are the most important part of the non-specific defence response to viral infections. Interferons classically appear within hours of initiation of viral replication, in contrast to antibodies, which take some days to appear. They are species-specific, so therapy with animal interferons is ineffective in humans.

### Q94	
_Indications for splenectomy_ include all of the following, EXCEPT:

	A. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) - T
	B. Felty syndrome
	C. Thrombocytopenia associated with drug abuse - T
	D. Sickle cell disease without hypersplenism
	E. Splenomegaly related to haemodialysis

#### Answer: E. Splenomegaly related to haemodialysis - *FALSE* = D. Sickle cell disease without hypersplenism - TRUE
- Numerous reasons exist for splenectomy in the non-trauma setting. The incidence of elective splenectomy in the UK has declined as this was used in the staging of lymphomas previously. Any cause of hypersplenism or thrombocytopenia resulting from hypersplenism can justify a splenectomy, as very large spleens can be symptomatic as well as have a very high incidence of rupture from trauma. Spleens, occasionally can cause pressure symptoms if large enough.
 
### Q95	
The clinical presentation of _neurogenic shock_ includes which one of the following combinations of signs?

	A. Hypotension, bradycardia, warm skin
	B. Hypotension, tachycardia, warm skin
	C. Hypotension, bradycardia, cool skin
	D. Hypotension, tachycardia, cool skin
	E. Hypertension, bradycardia, cool skin

#### Answer: C. Hypotension, bradycardia, cool skin - *FALSE* = A. Hypotension, bradycardia, warm skin - TRUE
- Neurogenic shock is shock caused by the sudden loss of the sympathetic nervous system signals to the smooth muscle in vessel walls. This results in the triad of bradycardia, hypotension and peripheral vasodilatation, resulting from loss of sympathetic tone. This should be distinguished from septic shock, which results classically in a tachycardia and hypotension.
 
### Q96	
A woman with _suspected breast cancer_ has fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a breast lump. The report comes back as 'C3'. What does this mean?

	A. Equivocal - C3
	B. Suspicious for cancer - C4
	C. Inadequate sample - C1
	D. Definitely malignant - C5
	E. Benign - C2

#### Answer: B. Suspicious for cancer - *FALSE* = A. Equivocal (C3) - TRUE
- Cytology reports grade samples according to the cellular appearances by a 5-point system
	- C1 = inadequate sample
	- C2 = benign
	- C3 = **equivocal**
	- C4 = suspicious for malignancy
	- C5 = malignant
- Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) forms part of the triple assessment for suspected breast cancer
	- along with clinical examination and imaging (mammogram or ultrasound)
 
### Q97	
Which of the following statements regarding _suxamethonium_ is TRUE?

	A. It is a non-depolarising muscle relaxant
	B. It is not very useful in crash inductions
	C. It is structurally similar to the acetylcholine molecule
	D. Prolonged action can be due to the presence of too much plasma cholinesterase - F
	E. It has a half-life of 10 minutes, making it short-acting - F

#### Answer: C. It is structurally similar to the acetylcholine molecule - TRUE
- Suxamethonium is a short-acting, depolarising muscle relaxant useful in anaesthesia for performing intubation in the induction phase
- Structurally similar to the ACh molecule (double-ACh structure)
- Has a very short half-life of a few minutes
	- Complete metabolism by plasma cholinesterase in 5–10 minutes
 
### Q98	
The following _brachial plexus injuries_ would all give rise to the accompanying deficits, EXCEPT:

	A. Radial nerve lesion – wrist drop - T
	B. Ulnar nerve lesion – claw deformity - T
	C. Axillary nerve injury – insensate shoulder patch - T
	D. Median nerve palsy – weakened thumb movements + loss of sensation to lateral palm - T
	E. Thoracodorsal nerve injury – winged scapula - F

#### Answer: E. Thoracodorsal nerve injury – winged scapula - TRUE
- The thoracodorsal nerve supplies the latissimus dorsi muscle
	- One of major adductors of shoulder joint as well as an extensor and medial rotator
- A winged scapula would result from an injury to the long thoracic nerve of Bell
	- Arising from roots of C5, 6 and 7 of brachial plexus 
- Both of these nerves are commonly encountered in axillary dissection procedures and can be injured here as well.
 
### Q99	
Which of the following statements about the _coronary circulation_ is FALSE?

	A. Most of the perfusion of the left ventricle occurs during diastole - T
	B. Direction of blood flow to the myocardium is from the outer surface of the heart inwards - T
	C. Changes in blood flow in the coronary arteries occur by auto-regulation
	D. The interventricular septum is supplied by the left coronary artery only - F
	E. The right coronary artery arises from the right aortic sinus

#### Answer: D. The interventricular septum is supplied by the left coronary artery only - TRUE
- Blood flows in an ‘outward to inward’ direction towards the myocardium. During systole, contraction of the ventricles causes compression of the coronary vessels, reducing or even reversing blood flow. This means that it is in diastole when the most blood reaches the myocardium of the left ventricle. Changes in myocardial activity and demand result in release of mediators, which autoregulate the coronary flow according to need. The right coronary artery, which arises from the right aortic sinus, mainly supplies the right ventricle. The left coronary artery, which arises from the left aortic sinus, supplies the left ventricle. Blood supply to the atria is variable. 
- The interventricular septum is supplied by both arteries

	A. Helicobacter pylori
	B. Atrophic gastritis
	C. Blood group A
	D. Pernicious anaemia
	E. Low socioeconomic class

:#### Answer: A. Helicobacter pylori - *FALSE* = B. Atrophic gastritis - TRUE
- Atrophic gastritis and hypogammaglobulinaemia are both associated with a 30-fold increase
- The other conditions listed have proved risks of developing gastric carcinoma but not as great

### Q102
Colonic diverticular disease:

	A. Can present with a colo-vesical fistula
	B. Does not present with colonic obstruction - F
	C. Is an inherited condition - F
	D. Is a premalignant condition
	E. Is not a feature of ageing - F

#### Answer: D. Is a premalignant condition - *FALSE* = A. Can present with a colo-vesical fistula - TRUE
- Diverticular disease occurs in the colon more frequently in the developed countries and increases with increasing age. It is not inherited and has no known risk of causing colorectal cancers. There are theories suggesting that their development may be due to high intraluminal pressures arising from diets that lack fibre and cause the colon to strain in propelling the stools along. Diverticular disease may present as diverticulitis, although it may also present as obstruction, perforation, or even as a fistula into surrounding organs such as bladder, uterus, vagina and even skin.
 
### Q103	
Which of the following _stoma complications_ makes closure technically easier?

	A. Parastomal hernia
	B. Prolapse - F
	C. Stenosis
	D. Retraction - F
	E. Ischaemia - F

#### Answer: C. Stenosis - *FALSE* = A. Parastomal hernia - TRUE

	- although obstruction does not typically occur from these hernias

### Q106
The commonest infection to affect the _asplenic patient_ following splenectomy is:

	A. Streptococcus pneumoniae
	B. Neisseria meningitidis - F
	C. Escherichia coli - F
	D. Haemophilus influenzae
	E. Staphylococcus aureus

#### Answer: D. Haemophilus influenzae - *FALSE* = A. Streptococcus pneumoniae - TRUE
- The asplenic patient is at risk of infections from encapsulated organisms such as streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae
- Commonest infection to affect asplenic patient out of this group is *Streptococcus pneumoniae*
- Regular immunisations as well as penicillin prophylaxis is mandatory for these patients
 
### Q107
All of the following statements regarding the _management of trauma in pregnant women_ are true, EXCEPT:

	A. A qualified surgeon and obstetrician should always be consulted early in the evaluation of the pregnant patient - T
	B. Small-bowel injury is commoner in upper abdominal penetrating wounds than lower penetrating injuries in late pregnancy - T
	C. Pregnant women show earlier signs of hypovolaemia during haemorrhage - F
	D. Unless contraindicated, pregnant women should be placed in the left-lateral position during assessment and management as early as possible - T
	E. All Rh-negative pregnant patients should be considered for Rh immunoglobulin therapy in penetrating abdominal injuries - T

#### Answer: E. All Rh-negative pregnant patients should be considered for Rh immunoglobulin therapy in penetrating abdominal injuries - *FALSE* = C. Pregnant women show earlier signs of hypovolaemia during haemorrhage - TRUE
- The management of a pregnant woman in the trauma setting is no different from that of a normal patient. In this case the mother rather than the fetus takes priority and an obstetrician needs to be involved from early on. A special consideration that needs to be addressed is that, in mid- to late pregnancy, a large uterus can compress the IVC when lying in the supine position, and so a left-lateral position whenever possible will provide a better volume return to the heart, as there is lack of caval compression. Pregnant women exhibit slightly altered physiology, which needs to be considered as well; they may not show signs of haemorrhage as they have a larger vascular volume.

### Q111 - LEARN
A man is found to have a PSA of 14 mg/ml on routine testing. He is entirely asymptomatic. Investigation with transrectal biopsy confirms _prostate cancer_. MRI scan shows a _nodule on the left lobe_, which extends into the _seminal vesicles_. The stage of prostate cancer based on this information is:

	A. T4
	B. T3a
	C. T2a
	D. T3b
	E. T2b

#### Answer: E. T2b - *FALSE* = D. T3b - TRUE

- Femoral hernias occur through femoral canal, which is under inguinal ligament, just medial to femoral vein
- Present as a lump in the groin situated below and lateral to pubic tubercle
	- often as an emergency
	- more commonly in elderly women
- Inguinal hernias present as a lump in the groin just above and medial to pubic tubercle

	E. Anatomical dead space is reduced in the standing-up position

#### Answer: C. Anatomical dead space can be measured using Fowler’s method - *FALSE* = E. Anatomical dead space is reduced in the standing-up position - TRUE
- Dead space is the volume of air that has to be ventilated, but does not actually take part in gas exchange. Anatomical dead space is the volume that does not mix with air in the alveoli, and physiological dead space is the volume of air that may reach the alveoli, but does not take part in gas exchange, eg due to lack of perfusion. Anatomical dead space will be increased in the standing position, with larger lung volumes and bronchodilatation. Physiological dead space is increased in hypotension, hypoventilation, pulmonary embolus, emphysema and positive-pressure ventilation.
 
### Q115 - LEARN
Which one of the following conditions would result in a _positive base excess_ on a blood gas report?

	A. Cushing syndrome
	B. Starvation
	C. Septicaemia
	D. Pulmonary embolus - F
	E. Myasthenia gravis - F

#### Answer: C. Septicaemia - *FALSE* = A. Cushing syndrome - TRUE
- Cushing syndrome classically causes a **hyPOkalaemia** and **metabolic alkalosis** 
	- resulting in a high bicarbonate serum level and positive base excess
- Starvation and septicaemia will both result in metabolic acidosis
- Respiratory acidosis in myasthenia gravis due to hypoventilation
- **NOTE** Respiratory alkalosis occurs in pulmonary embolus due to hyperventilation and tachypnoea
 
### Q116
A 47-year-old male patient received a cadaver kidney transplant with immediate function 2 weeks ago. Within 3 days his serum creatinine had normalised to 110 µmol/l. He was discharged on the 5th post-operative day and has been followed up at the transplant follow-up clinic, attending thrice weekly. On attendance today his serum creatinine is 167 µmol/l and he is well in himself with no symptoms. You note on checking the blood results that the creatinine was 115 µmol/l 2 days ago. His tacrolimus (immunosuppression drug) level is normal. Ultrasound scan shows a normal transplant kidney. What is the most likely cause of his raised serum creatinine?

	A. Acute rejection episode (and a transplant biopsy is urgently required to confirm the diagnosis)
	B. Acute tubular necrosis - F
	C. Volume depletion due to diarrhoea and vomiting - F
	D. Ureteric obstruction - F
	E. Transplanted renal artery stenosis

#### Answer: E. Transplanted renal artery stenosis - *FALSE* = A. Acute rejection episode (and a transplant biopsy is urgently required to confirm the diagnosis) - TRUE
- Volume depletion is not likely as the patient did not complain of diarrhoea or vomiting. The ultrasound scan would have excluded ureteric stenosis (hydronephrosis) and transplanted renal artery stenosis. Residual acute tubular necrosis does not usually lead to a jump in the serum creatinine level. The serum creatinine levels tend to plateau at a level above the normal range in such a case. Acute rejection should be suspected in this case and can be proved on an urgent biopsy.
 
### Q117
_Fever_ can be caused by all of the following, EXCEPT:

	A. Heatstroke - T
	B. Hyperthyroidism - T
	C. Posterior hypothalamic lesions

### Q118
Which of the following agents used in the treatment of urological conditions is NOT paired with its correct description?

	A. Mitomycin C – intravesical chemotherapy agent - T
	B. Finasteride – luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonist
	C. Oxybutinin – anticholinergic agent
	D. Tamsulosin – α-adrenergic blocker
	E. Flutamide – anti-androgen agent

#### Answer: D. Tamsulosin – α-adrenergic blocker - *FALSE* = B. Finasteride – luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) agonist - TRUE
- Mitomycin C is an agent instilled intravesically for the treatment of superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, to prevent a recurrence. Finasteride is a 5α-reductase inhibitor. By blocking the action of 5α-reductase, it reduces the formation of dihydrotestosterone, therefore reducing the stimulatory effect this has on prostate gland growth. Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic agent used in the management of detrusor instability. Tamsulosin is an α-adrenergic blocker used in the management of BPH. It causes smooth-muscle relaxation of prostate and bladder neck, therefore improving urine flow rates. Flutamine is used in the management of prostate cancer. It is an anti-androgen and works by preventing testosterone from causing growth of the tumour.
 
### Q119

	C. Reduced lung compliance - T
	D. PaO2/FiO2 ratio <26.6 kPa (200 mmHg) - T
	E. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >16 mmHg

#### Answer: E. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure >16 mmHg - TRUE

##### Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
- ARDS is an acute syndrome characterised by respiratory failure with
	- formation of **non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema** leading to 
		- Reduced lung compliance
		- Hypoxaemia refractory to oxygen therapy
	- Pulmonary wedge pressure is <16 mmHg 
	- Diffuse pulmonary infiltrates are seen 
	- PaO2/FiO2 ratio is <26.6 kPa (200 mmHg)
 
### Q120
The _superficial radial nerve_:

	A. Runs between brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus
	B. Runs between the brachialis and brachioradialis
	C. Is at a high risk of injury during the posterior approach to the forearm
	D. Supplies most of the muscles in the posterior compartment of the forearm
	E. Is difficult to see during surgery

#### Answer: D. Supplies most of the muscles in the posterior compartment of the forearm - *FALSE* = A. Runs between brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus - TRUE
- The radial nerve enters the forearm anterior to the lateral epicondyle, runs between brachialis and brachioradialis and divides into the superficial radial and posterior interosseous nerve (PIN). The PIN splits the supinator (site of damage during retraction of the muscle) and supplies all of the extensor muscles except brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis brevis and extensor carpi radialis longus. The superficial radial nerve passes to the dorsal radial surface of the hand in the distal third of the forearm by passing between brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus. It can be visualised during the anterior approach to the forearm.

### Q122
A man is found to have a hydrocele, which at operation is found to extend from the _testis to the deep inguinal ring_, but does not connect with the peritoneal cavity. Which of the following best describes this hydrocele?

	A. Vaginal hydrocele
	B. Congenital hydrocele - F
	C. Infantile hydrocele
	D. Hydrocele of cord - F
	E. Malignant hydrocele - F

#### Answer: A. Vaginal hydrocele - *FALSE* = C. Infantile hydrocele - TRUE
- A hydrocele is an abnormal collection of fluid in the tunica vaginalis surrounding the testis or spermatic cord. They occur in males of any age but are most common at extreme ends of the age spectrum. They can present from birth because during descent of the testis from the abdomen to the scrotum, a sac of peritoneum is pulled along, which envelops the testis and epididymis, creating a tubular communication between the abdomen and the tunica vaginalis of the scrotum. Usually the part surrounding the spermatic cord obliterates, therefore closing off this communication. If it does not, a congenital hydrocele is formed, where fluid accumulates within the patent processus vaginalis and around the testis. If the processus vaginalis obliterates at the level of the deep inguinal ring, the resulting hydrocele is an infantile hydrocele. If fluid is present in the tunica vaginalis surrounding the testis but not the spermatic cord, this is a vaginal hydrocele. A hydrocele of the cord is formed when the distal portion of the processus vaginalis closes, the midportion remains patent and fluid-filled and the proximal portion may be open or closed. In older men, an increase in the production of serous fluid by the tunica vaginalis (eg due to infection, trauma or tumour) can result in a hydrocele. In 10% of cases a testicular tumour is associated with a hydrocele.
 
### Q123
A 23-year-old man is brought into the Emergency Department after having sustained three stab wounds to the abdomen with evisceration of small bowel. A laparotomy is performed where _gross faecal contamination_ is found from _large-bowel lacerations_. The bowel injuries are resected and a _defunctioning ileostomy_ is performed. On the 4th post-operative day, the patient develops a temperature of 39°C with peritonitis as well as buttock myonecrosis with _foul-smelling discharge_. In this clinical scenario, which of the following organisms is most likely to have caused this infection?

	A. Helicobacter pylori - F
	B. Bacteroides fragilis
	C. Vibrio parahaemolyticus
	D. Salmonella typhi - F
	E. Shigella dysenteriae

#### Answer: E. Shigella dysenteriae - *FALSE* = B. Bacteroides fragilis - TRUE
- Bacteroides organisms are anaerobic, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative rods normally found within the human colon
	- They can cause endogenous infections and lead to peritonitis, sepsis and abscess formation
	- The polysaccharide capsule of the Bacteroides organisms is responsible for the high virulence factor
- Shigella, Salmonella, and Vibrio are all enteric pathogens that cause gastroenteritis
- Helicobacter pylori is a well-known cause of gastritis and is limited to the upper GIT
 
### Q124
The _most common problem_ following _total knee replacement_ (TKR) involves:

	A. Infection
	B. Incorrect prosthesis size - F
	C. Chronic pain - F
	D. Cosmesis - F
	E. Patellar tracking

	4. Maintenance of Q angle 
		- angle formed by intersection of extensor mechanism axis above patella with axis of patella tendon
- To avoid lateral subluxation of the patella 
	- femoral component is positioned laterally and rotated externally
	- internal rotation of the tibial component is avoided
	- the patellar component is medialised
	- and the joint position is maintained
 
### Q125 - LEARN
A 68-year-old man develops a massive acute _myocardial infarction_ and dies in hospital while being resuscitated in the Emergency Department. An autopsy is performed and, while you are inspecting the heart, you note that it has undergone necrosis as expected. 

Which _type of necrosis_ is found to be consistent with the pathology of this disease?

	A. Coagulative necrosis
	B. Liquefactive necrosis
	C. Fat necrosis - F
	D. Fibrinoid necrosis - F
	E. Caseating necrosis

#### Answer: A. Coagulative necrosis - TRUE
- Coagulative necrosis commonly occurs in fibrous or muscular tissue where the outline of the cell is retained, but not the cell nucleus. The brain classically undergoes liquefactive necrosis, which results from complete hydrolysis of the cell. Caseating necrosis is seen in cases of TB and may represent a combination of coagulative and liquefactive necrosis. Fat necrosis usually occurs in abdominal wall, pancreatic or breast tissue that has sustained trauma and has been damaged by lipases. Fibrinoid necrosis may be seen in damaged vessel walls where plasma proteins accumulate.

### Q127
Diagnostic _specificity_ is defined as:

	A. Probability of a negative diagnostic test in the presence of disease
	B. Probability of a positive diagnostic test in the presence of disease
	C. Probability of a negative diagnostic test in the absence of disease
	D. Probability of a positive diagnostic test in the absence of disease
	E. Probability of being disease-free and test-negative within all people testing negative

#### Answer: C. Probability of a negative diagnostic test in the absence of disease - TRUE
- Specificity refers to how well a test picks up disease-free individuals
- It is expressed as a proportion of 
	- disease-free individuals testing negative (true negatives) 
	- out of all disease-free individuals (true negatives plus false positives)
 
### Q128
Sertoli cells:

	A. Are involved in the nurturing of sperm cells within the seminiferous tubules
	B. Synthesise testosterone
	C. Secrete testosterone in response to LH
	D. Are known as interstitial cells of the testes
	E. Are able to continue proliferating once fully differentiated

#### Answer: A. Are involved in the nurturing of sperm cells within the seminiferous tubules - TRUE
- Sertoli cells are regarded as 'mother cells'
	- providing nutrition and wellbeing to the sperm cells within seminiferous tubules
- Once differentiated, they stop proliferating
- Leydig cells or interstitial cells synthesise and secrete testosterone 
	- in response to hormonal stimulation by LH and FSH
 
### Q129
A 15-year-old boy presents with sudden-onset right testicular pain associated with nausea and vomiting. On examination, the right testis is found to be drawn up into the groin with a horizontal lie and is very tender. What is the most appropriate form of management?

	A. Broad-spectrum antibiotics - F
	B. Exploration of testis via inguinal incision
	C. Bedrest and scrotal support - F
	D. ‘Watch and wait’ policy - F
	E. Exploration of testis via transverse incision over testis

#### Answer: E. Exploration of testis via transverse incision over testis - TRUE
- These symptoms are most likely to be due to a testicular torsion. This has to be considered a surgical emergency as the longer this is left, the higher the chance of testicular infarction. The purpose of surgery is to correct the torsion in the affected testis and to anchor the other testis to prevent future torsion. This can be achieved via a transverse incision over the testis or via a small midline incision in the scrotal raphe. If the testis is found to be clearly necrotic, it should be removed.
 
### Q130
In the _induction of anaesthesia_:

	A. Thiopentone injection results in a delayed recovery because of its high lipid solubility
	B. Propofol commonly causes nausea on recovery - F
	C. Ketamine is a stimulant that works by dissociation
	D. Ketamine is routinely used in adult anaesthesia - F
	E. Ketamine can cause a bradycardia on injection

#### Answer: E. Ketamine can cause a bradycardia on injection - *FALSE* = C. Ketamine is a stimulant that works by dissociation - TRUE
- Ketamine is a stimulant that works by dissociation
- Commonly causes a tachycardia and rise in blood pressure on injection
- Use is commonly within paediatric anaesthesia
- Commonest side effects are nightmares and hallucinations


Questions 131-135
-----------------

40% = F: 132, 134, 135

### Q131
The first step in the management of an episode of _massive haematemesis_ is:

	A. Insertion of two large-bore intravenous cannulae
	B. Urgent endoscopy - F
	C. Urgent angiography - F
	D. Clearing and securing the airway
	E. Resuscitation with fluids and blood products

#### Answer: D. Clearing and securing the airway - TRUE
- Airway, breathing and circulation (ABC) in that order are always mainstay of resuscitation measures
- Massive haematemesis requires resuscitation first; then proceed or transfer to definitive treatment
 
### Q132
All of the following statements regarding polytetrafluoroethylene (polytef or PTFE) are correct, EXCEPT:

	A. Pre-clotting is not required before use - T
	B. It allows tissue ingrowth and neo-intima formation - T
	C. It is a hydrophobic-non-elastic polymer - T
	D. Platelet deposition can occur on its surface
	E. It is used in the creation of arteriovenous (AV) fistulae - T

#### Answer: E. It is used in the creation of arteriovenous (AV) fistulae - *FALSE* = D. Platelet deposition can occur on its surface - TRUE
- Smooth inert surface of PTFE as well as negatively charged surface inhibits platelet deposition
	- Bleeding can sometimes be a problem through pores made by suture needles
 
### Q133
Which of the following features is found with a _large pulmonary embolus_ (PE)?

	A. Decreased pulmonary vascular resistance - F
	B. Pulmonary hypertension
	C. Increased left ventricular output
	D. Decreased right ventricular afterload - F
	E. Increased lung compliance - F

#### Answer: B. Pulmonary hypertension - TRUE

##### Large Pulmonary Embolus: Physiological Changes
- Increased pulmonary vascular resistance
- **Pulmonary hypertension**
- Decreased left ventricular output
- Increased right ventricular afterload
- Decreased lung compliance
- Impaired gas exchange
 
### Q134
All of the following drugs can cause _acute pancreatitis_, EXCEPT:

	A. Furosemide
	B. Azathioprine
	C. Didanosine
	D. Tetracycline
	E. Omeprazole
#### Answer: C. Didanosine - *FALSE* = E. Omeprazole - TRUE
- H2 antagonists (cimetidine and ranitidine) can lead to pancreatitis but not proton-pump inhibitors
 
### Q135
All of the following statements regarding _prostate cancer_ are true, EXCEPT:

	A. It is the second leading cause of male cancer deaths - T
	B. The lifetime risk of microscopic prostate cancer in all men is 30%
	C. The incidence is decreasing as a result of screening measures - F
	D. The lifetime risk of developing overt disease is 10% - T
	E. Consumption of carrots and cereals may have some protective effect - F
#### Answer: E. Consumption of carrots and cereals may have some protective effect - *FALSE* = C. The incidence is decreasing as a result of screening measures - TRUE
- Incidence of prostate cancer is rising as the general elderly population increases
- Average age of death in men is rising and so prostate cancer will be more prevalent
