	A. Right sternoclavicular joint (SCJ)
	B. Left sternoclavicular joint (SCJ)
	C. Right first costal cartilage junction
	D. Left first cost cartilage junction
	E. Manubriosternal joint

#### Answer: C. Right first costal cartilage junction - TRUE
- Right/Left brachiocephalic vein is formed behind Right/Left SternoClavicular Joint (SCJ) by union of: 
	1. Right/Left Internal Jugular Vein (IJV)
	2. Right/Left Subclavian Vein
- Both brachiocephalic veins join to form Superior Vena Cava (SVC) behind
	- **Right first costal cartilage junction** and descend to enter right atrium

### Q2

	A. Is bounded by the pulmonary arteries
	B. Forms a recess between the pericardium and the left atrium 
	C. Lies posteriorly between the aorta and pulmonary trunk anteriorly - F
	D. Lies anteriorly between the superior vena vaca (SVC) and left atrium - F
	E. Is smaller than the transverse sinus - F
	
#### Answer: A. Is bounded by the pulmonary arteries - *FALSE* = B. Forms a recess between the pericardium and the left atrium - TRUE
- **Note**: had this correct but changed answer!
- Pericardial sinuses (2x) are formed by 
	- Reflection of pericardium on heart and great vessels

##### Transverse Sinus
	- Lies posteriorly between aorta and pulmonary trunk
	- Lies anteriorly between superior vena cava (SVC) and left atrium

##### Oblique Sinus
	- Forms a recess between pericardium and left atrium 
	- Bounded by four pulmonary veins and inferior vena cava (IVC)

	D. Autonomic temperature control is regulated by the parasympathetic system
	E. Core temperature rises minimally during sleep
	
#### Answer: D. Autonomic temperature control is regulated by the parasympathetic system - *FALSE*
B. Hypothermia is defined as core temperature <35ºC - TRUE

1. Temperature control is regulated by hypothalamus + sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
	- Core temperature is generally about 0.5°C higher than axillary temperature
		- Normal range is between 36 °C and 37.5 °C
	- Temperature <35°C is regarded as **hypothermia**
		- Can often be fatal at levels under 30°C
		
2. Temperature variation can be seen throughout the day
	- Core temperatures being lower in morning and higher in evening
	
3. Variation may also be seen over menstrual cycle
	- T is 0.5 °C higher in latter half of the cycle
	- During sleep, core temperature *falls* slightly
	
4. Cardiac arrhythmias occur at core temperature below 32°C
	- Asystole can supervene below 28°C
	- Re-warming a patient can reactivate heart
	- Essential to re-warm patient before confirming cardiac arrest
	
### Q4 - LEARN

	A. The medial cord continues as the musculocutaneous nerve - F
	B. The posterior cord continues as the axillary nerve
	C. The lateral cord continues as the axillary nerve
	D. The nerve to subclavius is a branch of the C8 nerve root - F
	E. The suprascapular nerve is a branch of the lower trunk - F
	
#### Answer: B. The posterior cord continues as the axillary nerve - TRUE
- Medial Cord continues as Ulnar nerve
- Lateral Cord continues as Musculocutaneous Nerve
- **Posterior Cord** continues as Radial Nerve + Axillary Nerve
- Nerve to subclavius is a branch of C6 root
- Suprascapular nerve is a branch from upper trunk

### Q5
Structure NOT at risk of being damaged during carotid endarterectomy include the:

	A. Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)
	B. Greater auricular nerve
	C. Vagus nerve 
	D. Recurrent laryngeal nerve
	E. (Spinal) Accessory nerve (CN XI)

#### Answer: E. (Spinal) Accessory Nerve (CN XI) - TRUE
- Following nerves are **all** at risk during Carotid Endarterectomy:
	- Vagus Nerve (CX X)
	- Hypoglossal Nerve (CN XII)
	- Greater Auricular Nerve 
	- Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve
- Following nerves are **not** at risk: **'S' == NOT at risk**
	- (Spinal) Accessory Nerve (CN XI)
	- Superior Laryngeal Nerve

### Q6
For a 70 kg man, the volume of intracellular water in the body in litres (L) is approximately:

	A. 11 L 
	B. 14 L 
	C. 28 L
	D. 35 L
	E. 42 L 
	
#### Answer: C. 28 L - TRUE
- 70 kg * 60% * 2/3 = 42 * 2/3 = 28 L

- Water in average 70-kg male is ~60% of body weight (42 L)
	- **Intracellular: 2/3 (= 28 L)** 	
	- Extracellular: 1/3 (= 14 L)
- Extracellular Compartment
	- Plasma (3 L)
	- Interstitial Fluid (11 L), part of which is
		- Transcellular Fluid (1 L)
			- Cerebrospinal fluid
			- Peritoneal fluid
			- Intraocular fluid 

### Q7
A 72-yo man underwent an emergency operation for a strangulated inguinal hernia, during which he also had a small-bowel resection for infarcted bowel. He is noted on post-operative bloods to have a potassium of 6.5 mmol/L. In looking at his past medical history, he suffers from hypertension, adrenal problems, and a recently Dx oesophageal stricture. HyPERkalaemia in this patient is most likely to result from:

	A. HyPERaldosteronism
	B. Metabolic acidosis
	C. Steroid therapy
	D. Loop diuretics - F
	E. Dysphagia - F

#### Answer: B. Metabolic acidosis - TRUE (Guess)
- Hyperkalaemia can result from decreased excretion, increased extraneous load, or release from cells
- In this gentleman, cell lysis from the infarcted bowel is the most likely cause and he would also have a metabolic (lactic) acidosis, which would also result in hyperkalaemia
- In the post-operative period, secretion of ADH in response to the operation also tends to raise serum potassium levels
- The best answer from the choices given is therefore metabolic acidosis

##### Decreased Excretion
- Renal failure
- Potassium-sparing diuretics
- Adrenocortical insufficiency
- **Metabolic acidosis**

##### Increased Extraneous Load
- Potassium chloride
- Blood transfusion
- Potassium citrate

##### Release From Cells
- Acidosis
- Rhabdomyolysis
- Tumour lysis
- Succinylcholine
- Digoxin poisoning
- Vigorous exercise

### Q8

	A. Heart failure
	B. HyPOalbuminaemia
	C. Diabetes Insipidus - F
	D. Addison's disease
	E. Post-operative excess IV 5% dextrose prescribing - T

#### Answer: C. Diabetes Insipidus - TRUE
- HyPOnatraemia is defined as a serum sodium concentration of < 135 mmol/L
- TODO

### Q9 - LEARN
The correct composition of _Hartmann's solution_ is as follows (mmol/L):

	| Na	| Cl	| Dex	| K		| PO4	| Ca	| HCO3	|
----|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
A	| 154	| 154	| –		| 20	| –		|  2	| 18
B	| 131	| 111	| –		|  5	| –		|  2	| 29
C 	| 129	| 109	| –		|  4	| 1.5	|  –	| 29
D 	|  30	|  30	| 222	|  2	| –		|  2	| –
E 	| 147	| 156	| –		|  4	| –		| 22	| –

#### Answer: B: Na 131, Cl 111, HCO3 29, K 5, Ca 2 - TRUE
- Hartmann’s solution is a crystalloid solution (isotonic with body fluid)
	- Na+ 	131 mmol/l
	- Cl- 	111 mmol/l
	- HCO3-  29 mmol/l
	- K+ 	  5 mmol/l
	- Ca2+ 	  2 mmol/l
- As composition is near-physiological, it is commonly used intraoperatively to replace fluid losses

### Q10 - LEARN
The abdominal aorta lies on the:

	A. Left of sympathetic trunk - F
	B. Left on inferior mesenteric vessels - F
	C. Left of azygos vein - T
	D. Right of Cisterna Chyli - F

- Aorta lies on RIGHT of 
	- Sympathetic Trunk
	- Inferior Mesenteric Vessels
	- Left Crus of Diaphragm
	- Coeliac Ganglion
- Aorta lies on LEFT of
