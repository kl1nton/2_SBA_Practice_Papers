### Q12
Which of the following _antiemetics_ is correctly classed as a _5-HT3 antagonist_:

	A. Prochlorperazine
	B. Metoclopramide
	C. Ondansetron
	D. Hyoscine
	E. Cyclizine

#### Answer: C. Ondansetron - TRUE
- Ondansetron is an example of a 5-HT3 antagonist. The main mechanism of action lies in the blockage of the receptors, which are located in the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). The CTZ is found within the area postrema of the brainstem and is a direct stimulator of the vomiting centre in the medulla oblongata. The CTZ also contains D2 receptors, which can be blocked by the use of dopamine antagonists such as prochlorperazine and metoclopramide. Hyoscine works as an antimuscarinic agent and cyclizine as an antihistamine. Both muscarinic and histamine receptors are present directly on the vomiting centre, and blockage of these is used to reduce motion sickness-induced nausea.

### Q13
Which of the following _parenteral analgesics_ would be the most appropriate in a severely injured, _haemodynamically unstable_ patient following a road traffic accident?

	A. Paracetamol
	B. Morphine - F
	C. Midazolam
	D. Propofol - F
	E. Fentanyl

#### Answer: A. Paracetamol - *FALSE* = E. Fentanyl = TRUE
- Paracetamol is a weak analgesic in the setting of severe trauma. Morphine administration should be avoided as it is associated with histamine release, which can result in vasodilatation and worsening hypotension in the unstable patient. Propofol and midazolam have no analgesic properties. Fentanyl is ideal for use in haemodynamically unstable patients with severe injuries as it is a very strong analgesic with a rapid onset of action and short half-life, with no resultant metabolites.

### Q18	
Which of the following statements regarding _pulmonary physiology_ is CORRECT?

	A. Pulmonary airways are all collapsible - F
	B. An increased systemic PCO2 causes a respiratory alkalosis - F
	C. The Haldane effect promotes the transport of O2 in systemic arterial blood
	D. Respiratory chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies are the most important in the ventilatory response to an elevated Po2
	E. Ventilation can be increased in respiratory failure

#### Answer: C. The Haldane effect promotes the transport of O2 in systemic arterial blood - *FALSE* = E. Ventilation can be increased in respiratory failure - TRUE
- Not all pulmonary airways are collapsible because bronchi contain cartilage and therefore do not collapse. An increased systemic PCO2 causes an acidosis due to increased carbonic acid formation. The function of central chemoreceptors (medullary neurones) is to detect changes in PO2 levels. Chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies are peripheral chemoreceptors which respond to changes in blood PCO2 and pH, as well as PO2. During respiratory failure a patient might hyperventilate in an attempt to correct abnormal arterial gases. Hyperventialtion can also occur with an emotional upset, in response to a metabolic acidosis (in this instance the PCO2 concentration drops, helping the pH to return to normal), and with marked falls in arterial pressure (this effect is mediated via chemoreceptor stimulation in conditions of very low blood flow, when the tissue PO2 falls).
 
##### Notes
- Haldane effect relates to CO2 transport – **Bohr effect** relates to O2 transport
- The Haldane effect promotes CO2 release in pulmonary capillaries as PO2 rises
	- Almost doubling amount of CO2 which is taken up by blood as it passes through systemic capillaries

### Q21
During the surgical ward round, you note that two of your patients are on the ITU following complicated emergency abdominal surgery. The ITU nurse mentions that both of your patients are still requiring inotropes. Which of the following _inotropes_ are commonly used in the _management of sepsis_ in an ITU setting?

	A. Dobutamine
	B. Adrenaline (epinephrine)
	C. Dopamine
	D. Noradrenaline (norepinephrine)
	E. Isoprenaline

#### Answer: A. Dobutamine - *FALSE* = D. Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) - TRUE
- Sepsis induces systemic vasodilatation. Adrenaline works on α1, β1 and β2 receptors and while it does have a role in sepsis it is not frequently used because of the β-agonist effect (more likely to cause tachycardia). Dobutamine also works primarily on β receptors. Dopamine has a dose-dependent effect on β, α and δ receptors. Noradrenaline increases blood pressure and cardiac output by a vasocontrictive α1 effect. Isoprenaline is a β-selective agonist.
 
### Q22	
The following statements regarding the _absolute refractory period_ in the ventricles are correct, EXCEPT:

	A. This is the period when the ventricles are completely inexcitable - T
	B. It corresponds to the period of ventricular depolarisation
	C. It corresponds to the period of ventricular contraction
	D. It is shorter than the corresponding period in atrial muscle
	E. It decreases during sympathetic stimulation of the heart

#### Answer: C. It corresponds to the period of ventricular contraction - *FALSE* = D. It is shorter than the corresponding period in atrial muscle - TRUE
- The state in which the ventricles are completely inexcitable defines an ‘absolute refractory period’ during a heartbeat. During this absolute refractory period the ventricles are in a state of contraction where all the cells are completely depolarised and cannot be excited, ie it is impossible to generate another action potential. The refractory period limits the frequency at which action potentials can be generated to <1000/s and ensures that, once initiated, an action potential can only travel in one direction. Sympathetic stimulation results in a decreased refractory period, thereby permitting higher heart rates.

### Q23	
The role of coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass surgery is to improve coronary blood flow. In a normal, healthy 70-kg man, which of the following statements regarding _myocardial blood flow_ is correct?

	A. It is approximately 125 ml/min at rest - F
	B. It is increased by pain 
	C. The right coronary artery typically a third of the blood to the right ventricular muscle - F
	D. Occurs during systole and diastole - F
	E. It is independent of arterial pressure - F

#### Answer: B. It is increased by pain - *FALSE* = C. The right coronary artery typically a third of the blood to the right ventricular muscle - TRUE
- Myocardial blood flow is approx 250 ml/min at rest. This represents 5% of the cardiac output and is dependent on arterial pressure. Flow is seen in diastole and pain reduces myocardial blood flow.
 
### Q24	
Which of the following medications is NOT known to cause _renal failure_?

	A. Diclofenac - F
	B. Ciprofloxacin
	C. Simvastatin
	D. Furosemide
	E. Mannitol
#### Answer: D. Furosemide - *FALSE* = C. Simvastatin - TRUE
- Drugs can cause renal failure through a variety of mechanisms. Those that have a direct tubular effect include aminoglycosides, mannitol, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors and ciclosporin. Sulphonamides and aciclovir can cause tubular obstruction, and beta lactam antibiotics, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and furosemide can cause acute interstitial nephritis. Acute glomerulonephritis is a recognised complication of penacillamine use. Simvastatin is not known to cause renal impairment.

### Q26	
Regarding _shock_, which one of the following _associations_ is most correct?

	A. Cardiogenic shock is associated with a high cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) - F
	B. Septic shock is characterised by a low SVR and a high cardiac output
	C. Cardiogenic shock is best treated with noradrenaline (norepinephrine) - F
	D. Septic shock is characterised by a high SVR and a low cardiac output
	E. Noradrenaline is a vasodilator - F

#### Answer: D. Septic shock is characterised by a high SVR and a low cardiac output - *FALSE* = B. Septic shock is characterised by a low SVR and a high cardiac output - TRUE
- Shock is the inability of the body to maintain tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery to its tissues. Septic shock is characterised by vasodilatation (low SVR) and a hyperdynamic circulation / high cardiac output. Cardiogenic shock, on the other hand, generally results in a low cardiac output state with a high SVR to try to maintain tissue perfusion. Noradrenaline is a potent vasoconstrictor used in the treatment of septic shock. It is not used generally in the treatment of cardiogenic shock.

### Q27	
Your medical student has just performed her first _arterial blood gas_ (ABG) procedure and runs to the ITU to process the sample. She returns promptly with the results below and asks you to explain them. You outline the clinical picture and then describe the blood gas results.

Measurement	| Value		| Range		|
------------|-----------|-----------|
pH	  		| 7.39		|
Po2	  		| 14.6 kPa	|
Pco2	  	| 2.6 kPa	|
Bicarbonate	| 10 mmol/l	|
Base excess	| –13		|

Which statement best describes this arterial blood gas profile?

	A. Uncompensated respiratory acidosis
	B. Compensated respiratory acidosis
	C. Compensated metabolic acidosis
	D. Uncompensated metabolic acidosis
	E. Compensated respiratory alkalosis - F

#### Answer: C. Compensated metabolic acidosis - TRUE
- The blood gas profile given in the question is a compensated metabolic acidosis as the pH is within the normal range, but the low bicarbonate has been compensated for by hyperventilation (which has caused a low PCO2.) A base excess of –13 (or base deficit of 13) indicates that there is loss of bicarbonate, which must be replenished, in addition to the removal of the cause of metabolic acidosis, in order to achieve acid–base correction.

### Q28	- LEARN
Regarding _inotropes_ and circulatory support, which one of the following statements is correct?

	A. Dobutamine acts mainly on α-adrenergic receptors
	B. Salbutamol has maximal effect on β1-adrenergic receptors
	C. Noradrenaline has maximal effect on α-adrenergic receptors
	D. All inotropic agents are vasocontrictors
	E. Milrinone acts via adrenergic receptors

#### Answer: D. All inotropic agents are vasocontrictors - *FALSE* = C. Noradrenaline has maximal effect on α-adrenergic receptors - TRUE
- Noradrenaline is a vasoconstrictor and acts mainly via α-adrenergic receptors. Dopexamine acts via β1 and β2 receptors and has no α-adrenergic action. It is therefore an vasodilator. Inotropic agents can be vasodilators or vasocontrictors. Salbutamol acts via β2-adrenergic receptors. Milrinone is a type III phosphodiesterase inhibitor and acts by inhibiting the degradation of intracellular cyclic AMP, causing an increase in intracellular calcium concentration.

#### Answer: D. Subscapularis runs through a tunnel formed by the acromion and the coraco-acromial ligament - *FALSE* = E. It supports the shoulder joint but is deficient inferiorly - TRUE

- The rotator cuff is a ring of muscles that surrounds and strengthens the shoulder joint, but is deficient inferiorly. They attach at the level of the anatomical neck of the humerus. Specifically, the attachments are: subscapularis to the lesser tuberosity; supraspinatus, teres minor and infraspinatus to the greater tuberosity (in that order from above down). As well as moving the shoulder joint they also act as a muscular support. Supraspinatus runs thorough a tunnel formed by the acromion and the coraco-acromial ligament and its tendon is fused to the capsule of the shoulder joint.

### Q32	
A 61-year old man is referred to your surgical clinic with _right calf pain_ which occurs on walking **300 yards** and is relieved by rest. He has a past history of hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia and smokes 15 cigarettes a day. On examination, he has _weak groin pulses_ and _absent distal pulses_ on the right side and _weak pulses distal_ to a _normal femoral pulse on the left side_. Which of the following is the correct **next step** in managing this patient?

	A. Arrange a duplex scan of his vessels
	B. Arrange a digital subtraction angiogram
	C. Lifestyle advice and tightening of risk factor control
	D. Prescribe warfarin to prevent thrombus formation
	E. Elective admission for a left femoro-popliteal bypass graft - F

#### Answer: B. Arrange a digital subtraction angiogram - *FALSE* = C. Lifestyle advice and tightening of risk factor control - TRUE
- This patient has multiple vascular risk factors and a history which suggests a stenosis of the left superficial femoral artery. As he is able to walk 300 yards at present, most of his daily activities are not limited by this claudication. He needs an initial modification and tighter control of his hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia, which will prevent progression of his vascular disease. He also needs lifestyle advice – he should stop smoking altogether, eat a healthy diet and take regular exercise. He should be encouraged to walk through the pain. These initial measures might very well improve his symptoms of claudication but in a few people the disease can progress to a point where intervention is required. A duplex scan initially or angiogram might be worthwhile if any intervention is being considered at a later stage. He certainly should not be taken for surgery in the immediate instance and this can be undertaken should the disease or symptoms progress.
 
### Q33
An 81-year-old patient is noted to be in _atrial fibrillation_ but she states that she has never been on anticoagulation therapy.

	E. Spigelian hernias generally occur through the epiploic foramen of Winslow - F

#### Answer: C. A hernia containing a strangulated Meckel’s diverticulum is a Littre’s hernia - TRUE
- Paraumbilical hernias occur just above and just below the umbilicus and are more commonly seen in women. They are acquired, and predisposing factors are obesity and multiple pregnancies. They are at high risk of strangulation as the neck is usually narrow. A hernia that contains a strangulated Meckel’s diverticulum is known as a Littre’s hernia and can progress to gangrene, suppuration and formation of a local fistula. Hernias that present below and lateral to the pubic tubercle are femoral hernias as opposed to inguinal hernias, which present above and medial to the pubic tubercle. Hernias that appear spontaneously just superior to the iliac crest are most likely to be lumbar hernias. They occur through the lumbar triangle of Petit, formed by the iliac crest, posterior external oblique and anterior latissimus dorsi. Spigelian hernias present through the linea semilunaris at the lateral border of the rectus sheath. They occur at the point where the posterior rectus sheath becomes deficient posteriorly.

### Q44	
All of the following statements about radiotherapy are true, EXCEPT:

	A. It can be administered via X-rays - T
	B. The nature of the surrounding tissue influences how much radiotherapy is administered
	C. Multiple fractions are required for palliation of bone pain - T
	D. Seminomas are very sensitive to radiotherapy
	E. Ulceration is a recognised complication - T

#### Answer: D. Seminomas are very sensitive to radiotherapy - *FALSE* = C. Multiple fractions are required for palliation of bone pain - TRUE
- Radiotherapy uses ionising radiation to kill cells. Doses are given at intervals, allowing the normal tissues to recover, but preventing the malignant cells, which take longer to regenerate, from growing. It works by damaging DNA through release of kinetic energy and can be administered through a variety of methods, including electrons, protons, neutrons, X-rays and gamma rays. The success of radiotherapy treatment is dependent on the radiosensitivity of the tumour (for example seminoma is very radiosensitive) and the tolerance of the surrounding tissue, as this can limit the amount of radiotherapy administered. It can be given as a primary treatment, adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy and as palliative treatment. Palliation of bone pain can be a single treatment. Complications include ulceration, bleeding, delayed wound healing and lymphoedema.

	B. In an average 20-year-old male, tidal volume is approximately 0.5 litres - F
	C. The residual volume is the amount of air remaining in the lungs after maximum expiration
	D. Total lung capacity is the sum of residual volume and tidal volume
	E. Vital capacity can be measured by spirometry - T
#### Answer: B. In an average 20-year-old male, tidal volume is approximately 0.5 litres - *FALSE* = D. Total lung capacity is the sum of residual volume and tidal volume - TRUE
- Lung function tests are useful pre-operatively as they provide the anaesthetist with information about lung function and capacity. Lung volumes vary with sex/height but not weight. The tidal volume is the amount of air moved into/out of the lung during quiet respiration. The amount of air that can be inspired on top of this is the inspiratory reserve volume, and the amount of air that can be forcibly expired on top of the tidal volume is the expiratory reserve volume. Air left in the lung at the end of a maximal expiration is the residual volume. The residual volume together with the expiratory reserve volume is the functional residual capacity. This is important as it is the volume in which gas exchange takes place. Total lung capacity is the sum of the residual volume and the vital capacity, which is the volume expired after a maximum inspiration.

#### Answer: D. Damage to the (spinal) accessory nerve - TRUE
- Carotid endarterectomy is a procedure carried out to remove an atherosclerotic plaque from the carotid artery in patients who have suffered transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) or (CVAs). The procedure is usually restricted to those who have 70% stenosis of the artery or above because it is at this point that the benefits outweigh the risks of the operation. It involves making an incision in the neck and locating the carotid artery, clamping it above and below the stenosis, creating a bypass for the blood to flow to the head during the operation and incising the artery to remove the plaque. The major risks involved include CVA (1–3%), MI (the most common cause of mortality), glossopharyngeal nerve injury and re-accumulation of the atheroma.

	B. They are operated on when <5.5 cm in diameter - F
	C. They can cause emboli
	D. They are not identified on ultrasound scan
	E. They are more common in females - F

#### Answer: D. They are not identified on ultrasound scan - *FALSE* = C. They can cause emboli - TRUE
- Elective surgery is normally carried out for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) only if the patient is relatively fit and has an aneurysm >5.5 cm in diameter, as the mortality for the operation is 5%. Endoluminal stenting is a relatively new alternative that can be used to treat infrarenal aneurysms. Overall mortality in ruptured aneurysms is 75% and unstable patients should proceed to urgent surgery. Ultrasound scan or CT scan can aid diagnosis, and regular ultrasound scans are a means of carrying out regular surveillance of aneurysms not large enough to require surgery. Thrombus formation within aneurysms can lead to distal emboli. AAAs are much more common in men.

	B. Chondrosarcoma
	C. Bone cyst
	D. Bone metastasis
	E. Ewing’s sarcoma

#### Answer: B. Chondrosarcoma - *FALSE* = C. Bone cyst - TRUE
- Bone cysts are common benign fluid-containing lesions that usually occur in the metaphysis of long bones. Half of all bone cysts present as pathological fractures and most occur in children aged 4–10 years. Bone metastases usually present with pain, although occurrence of a pathological fracture may be the first presentation. Osteosarcoma has a bimodal distribution, with 75% of those affected being aged between 10 and 25 years. The remainder are elderly with a history of Paget’s disease. It typically presents with a painful mass, most commonly affecting the lower femur and arising from the medullary cavity. Chondrosarcomas can present de novo or from malignant transformation of a benign cartilage tumour such an osteochondroma. They usually affect middle-aged or elderly people. Ewing’s sarcoma usually affects young people aged between 5 and 15 years. It presents as a lytic lesion, which causes a periosteal reaction, giving it a characteristic ‘onion skin’ appearance.

### Q101
A 26-year-old woman is involved in a road traffic accident. On arrival in the Emegency Department she has a painful, deformed-looking left leg, which is _shortened and internally rotated_. She is unable to dorsiflex or plantar-flex her foot and there is sensory loss below the knee apart from the medial leg and foot and upper back of the calf. The nerve most likely to have been affected is:

	A. Obturator nerve
	B. Sciatic nerve
	C. Femoral nerve
	D. Tibial nerve
	E. Common peroneal nerve

#### Answer: E. Common peroneal nerve - *FALSE* = B. Sciatic nerve - TRUE
- A posterior dislocation of hip causes the leg to appear shortened and internally rotated
- In 20% of fracture dislocations of the hip, the sciatic nerve is damaged
	- This results in paralysis of hamstrings and all flexors and extensors below knee
- Also, all of the skin below the knee loses its sensation apart from areas supplied by
	- saphenous nerve (medial posterior calf) 
	- posterior cutaneous nerve of thigh (upper posterior calf)

### Q104
A 35-year-old tennis player finds herself unable to play because of a _painful left shoulder_. Pain is worse on lifting the arm, particularly when _elevated between 60–120 degrees_. On examination there is tenderness just _lateral to the acromium_ process. The diagnosis is:

	A. Supraspinatus rupture
	B. Frozen shoulder
	C. Acromioclavicular joint dislocation
	D. Supraspinatus tendonitis
	E. Biceps tendon rupture - F

#### Answer: B. Frozen shoulder - *FALSE* = D. Supraspinatus tendonitis - TRUE
- Supraspinatus tendonitis is usually caused by vigorous exercise in people aged over 40 years. They present with a ‘painful arc’ of shoulder movement when the arm passes through 60–120 degrees of abduction. In contrast, supraspinatus rupture makes active abduction impossible, although there is a full range of passive movement. Frozen shoulder occurs as a result of degenerative changes of the rotator cuff. Pain due to this causes the patient to hold the shoulder still and adhesions form, which limit movement even more until only scapular movement remains. Rupture of the long head of biceps usually occurs in a previously diseased tendon and causes pain, tenderness and bunching-up of the muscle in the lower arm.

### Q107
All of the following statements about a _fractured neck of femur_ are true, EXCEPT:

	A. The affected leg is shortened and externally rotated - T
	B. Associated mortality is in the region of >30% at 6 months - T
	C. Intertrochanteric fractures are usually fixed using a dynamic hip screw - T
	D. Intracapsular fractures can result in avascular necrosis of the femoral head - T
	E. Femoral nerve injury is common

#### Answer: E. Femoral nerve injury is common - TRUE
- Fractured neck of femur is unfortunately a common injury in the elderly and mortality is in the region of 30% at 6 months. Patients usually present with a history of a fall and then inability to weight-bear on the affected side. On inspection the affected leg is shortened and externally rotated. The way in which fractured neck of femur is managed is dictated by the blood supply to the femoral head. A significant amount of the blood supply comes from the retinacular vessels, which pass proximally within the joint capsule. These vessels are therefore disrupted in intracapsular (subcapital) fractures. Undisplaced subcapital fractures have a good chance of maintaining the blood supply as there is minimal disruption of the capsule. They can generally be treated with insertion of cannulated screws. If they are displaced (ie Garden III and IV), there is a high risk of developing avascular necrosis of the femoral head and so hemiarthroplasty is the preferred management.

### Q110
A 67-year-old man presents _extremely unwell_ with left-sided abdominal pain, fever and shock. At emergency laparotomy he is found to have a _large tumour of the sigmoid colon_, which has _perforated_, causing _faecal contamination_. What is the most appropriate operation?

	A. Left hemicolectomy and primary anastomosis - F
	B. Sigmoid colectomy - F
	C. Hartmann’s procedure
	D. Anterior resection - F
	E. Abdominoperineal resection - F

#### Answer: C. Hartmann’s procedure - TRUE
- The safest operation to carry out in these circumstances, where a patient is unstable and the operating field is highly contaminated, is a Hartmann’s operation, where the affected segment of colon is excised and the proximal end is brought out as an end-colostomy. The rectal stump is closed and left inside or alternatively may be brought out as a mucous fistula. It is possible then to rejoin the two ends of bowel once the patient is in a more stable state and infection has settled to allow optimum conditions for forming an anastomosis.
