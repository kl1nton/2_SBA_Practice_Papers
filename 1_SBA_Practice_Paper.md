### Q7
A 72-yo man underwent an emergency operation for a strangulated inguinal hernia, during which he also had a small-bowel resection for infarcted bowel. He is noted on post-operative bloods to have a potassium of 6.5 mmol/L. In looking at his past medical history, he suffers from hypertension, adrenal problems, and a recently Dx oesophageal stricture. HyPERkalaemia in this patient is most likely to result from:
