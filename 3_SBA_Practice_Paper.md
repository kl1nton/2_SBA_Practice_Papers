	A. Pectineus
	B. Adductor longus
	C. Gracilis
	D. Obturator externus
	E. Adductor brevis
#### Answer: D. Obturator externus - *FALSE* = A. Pectineus
- Obturator Nerve is derived from the anterior primary rami of L2, L3 and L4 of the lumbar plexus
- Nerve supply to **adductors** and the skin overlying these muscles on **Medial Side of Thigh**
- It travels medially in relation to Psoas Major and passes through the **obturator foramen**
- It divides into anterior and posterior divisions around Adductor Brevis 

- 2x Branches of Obturator Nerve supply:
	- Anterior Branch
		- Adductor brevis
		- Adductor longus
		- Gracilis
	- Posterior Branch
		- Adductor magnus (also partly supplied by tibial nerve – hamstring portion)
		- Obturator externus

**Notes**
- Pectineus occasionally receives a nerve twig from Obturator Nerve
	- Although it is classically supplied by Femoral Nerve
 
### Q2	
Select the correct statement regarding *action potentials*:

	A. The size and shape of the action potential becomes smaller as it spreads across the membrane
	B. The size and shape of action potentials are the same from one excitable tissue to another - F
	C. The accumulation of positive charges due to Na+ influx promotes further depolarisation of the cell membrane
	D. Repolarisation after an action potential is due to inactivation of the postassium channels
	E. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a specific blocker of the potassium channel
#### Answer: D. Repolarisation after an action potential is due to inactivation of the postassium channels - *FALSE* = C. The accumulation of positive charges due to Na+ influx promotes further depolarisation of the cell membrane
- An action potential is a sequence of changes in the membrane potential that occurs when a nerve or muscle membrane impulse spreads over its surface. Any factor that increases the permeability of the cell to Na+ can elicit an action potential. Action potentials take different forms in terms of size and shape in different tissues (eg motor 2 ms, skeletal 5 ms and cardiac ventricle 200 ms). However, the action potential is propagated without decrement down the entire length of nerve or muscle fibres.
 
- The action potential is based on successive increases in conductance of Na+, then K+; there would be no net movement of ions across the membrane if this were to occur simultaneously. Action potentials are most often initiated by the opening of the ligand-gated ion channels that increase the permeability of the membrane to Na+, allowing these ions to enter the cells and thus cause Em (membrane potential) to move closer to ENa. In a resting cell the membrane potential is very close to the equilibrium potential of potassium. During an action potential, opening of the voltage-gated sodium channels leads to further depolarisation. This process becomes explosively self-regenerating when Em reaches about –45 mV to –50 mV. At the peak of depolarisation, around +35 mV, sodium channels deactivate and the permeability to Na+ rapidly diminshes. At the same time, voltage-gated potassium channels open so that Em moves back towards EK. During an action potential it is only the voltage-gated sodium channels that inactivate and not the potassium channels. TTX is a selective sodium-channel blocker that binds to the extracellular side.
 
### Q3	
Select the correct statement regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF):

	A. It is produced by specialised endothelial cells covering the choroid plexuses - F
	B. It has similar composition to plasma EXCEPT for glucose
	C. It is produced at 1.5 ml/min, allowing it to be turned over four times a day
	D. About half of the volume is distributed in the ventricles at any one time
	E. It plays a critical role in important brain functions and in providing nutritive support
#### Answer: C. It is produced at 1.5 ml/min, allowing it to be turned over four times a day - *FALSE* = E. It plays a critical role in important brain functions and in providing nutritive support
- CSF is produced largely by the choroid plexuses, which are capillary loops covered by specialised ependymal cells located in the ventricular system. It is produced at a rate of 0.35–0.5 ml/min, distributed approximately as 20 ml in the ventricles, 45 ml in the cranial subarachnoid space and the rest in the spinal subarachnoid space and central canal. CSF has lower concentrations of K+, glucose and protein but greater concentrations of Na+ and Cl– than blood. CSF is important in regulation of brain function in many ways, for example: CSF pH and PCO2 on respiration; CSF sodium chloride on AVP (vasopressin); CSF carriage of neuromodulators, eg opioids. It plays a minor role in supplying glucose to inaccessible areas.

	- Lactate
	- PO43- ion rise
	- Failure of Ca2+-ATPase of the *sarcoplasmic reticulum* 
 
### Q7	
A 23-year-old patient with *myasthenia gravis* is admitted under your care for a thymectomy. On further reading you discover that this autoimmune disorder affects the neuromuscular junction. Which one of the following statements concerning *neuromuscular junctions* is CORRECT?

	A. It is also known as a 'gap junction' - F
	B. Noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is the primary neurotransmitter in the neuromuscular junctions in the somatic nervous system - F
	C. Choline is synthesised in adequate amounts in the ends of motor neurones - F
	D. In myasthenia gravis the number of acetylcholine (Ach) molecules released is dramatically reduced
	E. It is an example of a chemical synapse - F
#### Answer: D. In myasthenia gravis the number of acetylcholine (Ach) molecules released is dramatically reduced - *FALSE* = E. It is an example of a chemical synapse
- The chemical synapses between the axons of motor neurones and skeletal muscle are called ‘neuromuscular junctions’. Gap junctions are the contact points between neurones which act as electrical synapses. The axon terminals are unmyelinated and contain many 40-nm-diameter synaptic vesicles containing ACh, the neurotransmitter employed at this synapse. The choline subunit cannot be synthesised by the motor neurone; it is obtained by active uptake from the extracellular fluid by Na+-coupled secondary active transporter in the nerve terminal.
 - Myasthenia gravis occurs as a result of the production of autoantibodies against the nicotinic receptor. This results in the production of a smaller action potential and subsequent weakened muscle contraction. There is a normal discharge of 100–220 vesicles even in myasthenia gravis. (Each vesicle or quantum contains 100 000 molecules of Ach.)

Questions 21-30
---------------

### Q21
Which of the following is NOT a possible long-term *complication of gastrectomy*?

	A. Bolus obstruction
	B. Dumping - T
	C. Weight gain
	D. Vitamin B12 deficiency - T
	E. Low serum calcium
#### Answer: A. Bolus obstruction - *FALSE* = C. Weight gain
- Gastrectomy is an effective treatment for gastric carcinoma but is associated with possible long-term complications. Dumping syndrome is caused by food and liquid passing too quickly into the small intestine causing abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, dizziness, sweating, nausea and vomiting. It is thought to be due to accelerated gastric emptying of hyperosmolar contents into the small bowel. This leads to fluid shifts from the intravascular compartment into the bowel lumen. It is often relieved by dietary changes. Another possible problem is vitamin B12 deficiency: the stomach is where intrinsic factor is secreted by the parietal cells and stomach acid also helps to release vitamin B12 from ingested food. Bolus obstruction can occur from the relative reduction in volume of the small intestine compared with the stomach. Hypocalcaemia can also occur post-gastrectomy and is due to increased transit time and therefore reduced time over which absorption can occur. 
- Because of this malabsorption, **weight loss** is commonly seen post-gastrectomy.
 
### Q22	
All of the following statements regarding *fracture healing* are true, EXCEPT:

	C. Lamellar bone is subsequently replaced by woven bone - F
	D. Maximum bony girth is normally attained within 3 weeks of the injury - F
	E. Remodelling takes place according to the direction of mechanical stress
#### Answer: C. Lamellar bone is subsequently replaced by woven bone - TRUE
- Bone healing occurs in well-defined stages after the initial trauma. The first stage is the formation of a haematoma from ruptured vessels and periosteum from the ends of the fracture. Following this, macrophages invade the haematoma, together with fibroblasts and polymorphs, to allow new vessel formation, fibrosis and the formation of an organised clot by the end of the first week. Osteoblasts then proceed to grow into the haematoma and form trabeculae of woven bone. This new bone is called ‘callus’ and can also contain some islands of cartilage, which are chondroblast-induced
- Woven bone is subsequently replaced by lamellar bone and remodelling occurs over time.
- Normal restoration can take up to a year, although, 
	- functionally, most bone is clinically healed within 8 weeks

### Q28	
A 40-year-old woman presents with right upper quadrant pain and nausea. Ultrasound scan reveals that she has cholecystitis and your consultant asks you to place the patient on a course of ciprofloxacin therapy. Which one of the following statements correctly represents the *mechanism of action of ciprofloxacin*?

	A. It binds to the 30s subunit of ribosomes
	B. It inhibits transpeptidase and cell wall synthesis
	C. It binds to the 50s subunit of ribosomes
	D. It inhibits DNA gyrase
	E. It competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase
#### Answer: D. It inhibits DNA gyrase - TRUE
- Ciprofloxacin works by blocking DNA synthesis in bacteria by inhibiting DNA gyrase. It is part of the quinolone group of antibiotics.

- Aminogylcosides such as gentamicin, as well as the tetracycline group of antibiotics, work by binding to the 30s subunit of ribosomes and preventing bacterial protein synthesis
	- In a similar way, chloramphenicol and macrolides such as erythromycin work by binding to the 50s subunit of bacterial ribosomes and so prevent protein synthesis as well.
 
- Penicillins and cephalosporins both inhibit transpeptidase and so inhibit bacterial cell wall synthesis
	- Resistant bacteria that possess the penicillinase enzyme can break down penicillin and render it inactive
 
- Competitive inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase occurs when trimethoprim is administered
	- This inhibits the production of tetrahydrofolic acid, which subsequently inhibits bacterial nucleic acid (precursor) synthesis
